  - `embeddings/vector_stack/` - Vector stack implementation
  - `tda/` - Various TDA algorithms and vectorizers
  - `finance/` - Financial analysis modules
  - `cybersecurity/` - Cybersecurity detection modules
  - `core/` - Core TDA utilities
  - `algorithms/` - Algorithm implementations
  - `models/` - Deep learning models
  - `workers/` - Background processing workers

### Research & Development
- **`notebooks/`** - Research notebooks and experiments
- **`external_repos/`** - External TDA libraries and research
- **`validation/`** - Validation scripts and results
- **`examples/`** - Various example implementations
- **`results/`** - Previous experimental results
- **`tests/`** - Test suites and validation code

- **`.cursor/`** - Development guidelines and rules
- **`.venv/`** - Python virtual environment
- **`GPT5THOUGHTS`** - Research insights and optimization strategies
- **`scripts/prd.txt`** - Product requirements document

### Data & Results
- **`data/apt-datasets/`** - Preserved for future use
- **`data/vector_stack_results/`** - Top 3 most recent vector stack runs
- **`src/python/vector_stack/`** - Enhanced vector stack implementation

## Why This Archive Exists

1. **Research Continuity**: Preserves valuable research insights
2. **Reference Material**: External repo analysis and integration patterns
3. **Performance Baseline**: Previous results for comparison
4. **Algorithm Reference**: Successful implementations to study
