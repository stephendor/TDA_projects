*"Those who do not learn from failed experiments are doomed to repeat them."*

This document tracks all attempted methodologies, their outcomes, and lessons learned to prevent repeating failed approaches and to build institutional knowledge.

## APT Detection Methodologies

### üíÄ "Improved" APT Detector (Ensemble + Enhanced Features)
**Date**: August 5, 2025  
**Duration**: 1 day  
**Approach**: Complex ensemble of IsolationForests + RandomForest + enhanced feature extraction + adaptive thresholding  

**Performance**:
- Baseline: 55-82% accuracy (varies by test data)
- "Improved": 50% accuracy  
- **Result**: -9.1% degradation (CRITICAL FAILURE)

**What We Tried**:
- Ensemble of 3 IsolationForest detectors with noise for diversity
- RobustScaler instead of StandardScaler
- Enhanced feature engineering (statistical, topological, stability features)
- Hybrid supervised/unsupervised approach
- Adaptive thresholding based on distance to baseline
- Temporal smoothing

**What Went Wrong**:
- Detector predicted ALL samples as APT (probability ~0.68)
- Ensemble voting biased toward positive predictions
- Complex feature engineering obscured signal rather than enhancing it
- Adaptive threshold calculation fundamentally broken
- No incremental validation - too many changes at once

**Root Cause**: Overly complex approach without understanding baseline problems. Added complexity without foundation.

**Lesson Learned**: Never build complex ensembles on top of poorly performing baselines. Understand why simple methods fail before adding complexity.

**Do Not Repeat**: Ensemble approaches on TDA features without proper baseline validation

**Salvageable Parts**: RobustScaler might be useful, some statistical features could work individually

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Baseline APT Detector (Single IsolationForest + Basic TDA)
**Date**: Project inception - August 5, 2025  
**Duration**: Multiple iterations  
**Approach**: Single IsolationForest on basic persistent homology + Mapper features  

**Performance**:
- Accuracy: 55-82% (highly variable depending on synthetic data)
- Inconsistent results across different test runs
- Poor precision/recall balance

**What We Tried**:
- Basic persistent homology features (birth-death pairs)
- Mapper algorithm features (nodes, edges, clustering)
- Simple statistical features
- StandardScaler preprocessing
- Various contamination thresholds (0.05, 0.1, 0.15)

**What Went Wrong**:
- Synthetic data too simplistic (Gaussian blobs don't represent real APTs)
- TDA applied to wrong data representation (point clouds vs time series)
- No temporal analysis despite APTs being temporal phenomena
- Poor feature engineering for network security domain

**Root Cause**: Fundamental mismatch between TDA application and problem domain. Treating network data as static point clouds instead of temporal/graph structures.

**Lesson Learned**: TDA methods need to match the natural structure of the data. Network security is inherently temporal and graph-based.

**Do Not Repeat**: Applying TDA to network features as simple point clouds

**Salvageable Parts**: Core TDA algorithms work, just need proper application to temporal/graph data

## Experiment Tracking Log

### Current Active Experiments

#### Real Data TDA Analysis (CIC-IDS2017)
**Status**: üîÑ In Progress  
**Started**: August 5, 2025  
**Approach**: Proper temporal TDA analysis on real network flow data  
**Expected Completion**: TBD (waiting for data download)

### Completed Experiments

#### Synthetic APT Data Generation (Multiple Attempts)
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Successful  
**Date**: Project inception - July 2025  
**Outcome**: Created basic synthetic data, but too simplistic for real validation
**Performance**: Enabled basic algorithm development but poor real-world relevance
**Lesson**: Need domain expertise to create realistic synthetic APT patterns
**Action**: Replaced with real dataset acquisition strategy

### Cancelled/Abandoned Experiments

#### Complex Multi-Scale TDA (apt_detection_optimized.py) 
**Status**: üíÄ Abandoned  
**Date**: August 5, 2025  
**Reason**: Overly complex, built on failed "improved" detector foundation
**Lines of Code**: 902 lines
**Time Investment**: 4+ hours
**Lesson**: Don't build complexity on broken foundations
**Action**: Code archived, approach abandoned

## Methodology Decision Log

### August 5, 2025 - APT Detection Strategy Pivot
**Decision**: Abandon ensemble TDA approach, pivot to real data + proper temporal TDA  
**Rationale**: 
- Multiple failures with synthetic data approaches
- Clear evidence that TDA needs proper application to temporal/graph structures  
- Real data essential for meaningful validation

**Evidence**:
- Debug tests showing complete failure of "improved" detector
- Literature review showing TDA success with temporal analysis
- Available real datasets (CIC-IDS2017) suitable for proper TDA application

**Stakeholders**: Project lead (user), technical implementation (assistant)
**Risk**: Medium - new approach, but solid theoretical foundation
**Success Metrics**: Match or exceed baseline methods on real APT data

## Research Insights

### What We've Learned About TDA for APT Detection
1. **Data Representation is Critical**: TDA methods must match data structure
2. **Temporal Analysis Essential**: APTs are temporal phenomena, not static patterns  
3. **Real Data Required**: Synthetic data misled development efforts
4. **Incremental Validation**: Test each component before building complexity
5. **Domain Knowledge Matters**: Network security expertise needed for feature engineering

### What We've Learned About Methodology Development
1. **Baseline First**: Always establish simple, working baseline before adding complexity
2. **Test Incrementally**: Add one improvement at a time with validation
3. **Honest Assessment**: Report failures immediately to prevent wasted effort
4. **Document Everything**: Failed approaches contain valuable lessons

## Future Research Directions

### Promising Approaches to Investigate
1. **Temporal TDA**: Persistent homology on time series of network flows
2. **Graph TDA**: Topological analysis of network connection evolution
3. **Multi-Scale Analysis**: Different time windows for different attack phases
4. **Mapper on Network Topology**: Visualize attack progression through network

### Approaches to Avoid
1. **Complex Ensembles**: Don't ensemble poorly performing base methods
2. **Feature Engineering Without Domain Knowledge**: Generic features don't help
3. **Synthetic Data Over-Reliance**: Real data essential for validation
4. **Black Box Optimization**: Understand why methods fail before trying to fix
