# TDA Improvement Strategy 🚀

**Based on**: TDA_ML Ideas.md analysis and validation results  
**Current Performance**: F1-Score 18.2% (vs 95.2% Random Forest baseline)  
**Target**: Achieve competitive performance (F1 >50%) within 4 weeks  

## Executive Summary

Our TDA approach significantly underperforms traditional methods (-77% F1-score gap). However, analysis of advanced TDA techniques suggests **5 concrete improvement strategies** that could bridge this gap:

1. **Multi-Scale Temporal TDA** - Capture attack patterns across multiple time horizons
2. **Persistence Landscapes + Deep Learning** - Replace basic vectorization with sophisticated ML fusion
3. **Graph-Based TDA on Network Topology** - Apply TDA to connection graphs, not just flow features  
4. **Hybrid TDA+Statistical Features** - Ensemble topological with classical features
5. **Topological Attention Mechanisms** - Learn which topological features matter most

## Strategy 1: Multi-Scale Temporal TDA 🕐

### Problem with Current Approach
- Uses single 60-flow window size
- Misses long-term APT campaign patterns (days/weeks)
- No analysis of temporal persistence evolution

### Proposed Solution
Apply TDA at multiple temporal scales simultaneously:

**Implementation**:
```python
# Multiple window sizes for different attack phases
window_sizes = [
    10,   # Tactical: Individual attack actions (seconds-minutes)
    60,   # Operational: Attack sequences (minutes-hours) 
    300,  # Strategic: Campaign coordination (hours-days)
    1440  # Persistent: Long-term infiltration (days-weeks)
]

# For each window size, compute TDA features
multi_scale_features = []
for window_size in window_sizes:
    sequences = create_tda_sequences(data, window_size)
    ph_features = compute_persistence_features(sequences)
    multi_scale_features.append(ph_features)

# Concatenate all scales
final_features = np.concatenate(multi_scale_features, axis=1)
```

**Expected Improvement**: +15-25% F1-score
- **Rationale**: APTs operate across multiple timescales - capturing this should significantly improve detection

## Strategy 2: Persistence Landscapes + Transformer Architecture 🧠

### Problem with Current Approach  
- Basic persistence diagram vectorization
- No sophisticated ML integration
- Misses temporal dependencies in topological features

### Proposed Solution
Replace current approach with state-of-the-art TDA+Deep Learning fusion:

**Implementation**:
```python
class TopologicalTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, tda_feature_dim, sequence_length):
        super().__init__()
        self.tda_processor = PersistenceLandscapeEncoder(tda_feature_dim)
        self.temporal_encoder = nn.TransformerEncoder(
            nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(d_model=128, nhead=8),
            num_layers=4
        )
        self.classifier = nn.Linear(128, 2)
    
    def forward(self, tda_sequences):
        # Process each timestep's TDA features
        landscape_features = self.tda_processor(tda_sequences)
        
        # Apply temporal attention to topological evolution
        temporal_features = self.temporal_encoder(landscape_features)
        
        # Classification
        return self.classifier(temporal_features.mean(dim=1))
```

**Expected Improvement**: +20-30% F1-score
- **Rationale**: Transformers excel at learning temporal dependencies, which is exactly what we need for APT detection

> "This project directly tackles this research gap of integrating temporal dependencies of topological features"

## Strategy 3: Graph-Based Network Topology TDA 🕸️

### Problem with Current Approach
- Applies TDA to flow features as point clouds
- Ignores network connection topology
- Missing graph-theoretic attack patterns

### Proposed Solution
Apply TDA to network connection graphs over time:

**Implementation**:
```python
def create_network_topology_features(network_flows):
    """Convert network flows to temporal graph sequence with TDA analysis"""
    
    # Build connection graph for each time window
    graphs = []
    for window in sliding_windows(network_flows, window_size=100):
        # Create weighted graph: nodes=hosts, edges=connections
        G = nx.Graph()
        for flow in window:
            src_ip = flow['Source IP']
            dst_ip = flow['Destination IP']
            weight = flow['Flow Bytes/s']
            
            if G.has_edge(src_ip, dst_ip):
                G[src_ip][dst_ip]['weight'] += weight
            else:
                G.add_edge(src_ip, dst_ip, weight=weight)
        
        graphs.append(G)
    
    # Apply TDA to graph evolution
    tda_features = []
    for G in graphs:
        # Convert graph to distance matrix
        distance_matrix = nx.floyd_warshall_numpy(G)
        
        # Compute persistent homology
        ph = PersistentHomologyAnalyzer(metric='precomputed')
        ph.fit(distance_matrix)
        features = ph.extract_features()
        tda_features.append(features)
    
    return np.array(tda_features)
```

**Expected Improvement**: +10-20% F1-score  
- **Rationale**: Network topology changes are fundamental to APT lateral movement patterns

> "Expected: Lateral movement, command & control patterns"

## Strategy 4: Hybrid TDA+Statistical Ensemble 🔬

### Problem with Current Approach
- Pure TDA approach ignores classical statistical signals
- No ensemble with proven baseline methods

### Proposed Solution
Create ensemble combining TDA insights with statistical performance:

**Implementation**:
```python
class HybridTDAEnsemble:
    def __init__(self):
        # TDA component for topological insights
        self.tda_model = TopologicalTransformer()
        
        # Statistical component for performance
        self.statistical_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
        
        # Meta-learner to combine predictions
        self.meta_learner = LogisticRegression()
    
    def fit(self, X, y):
        # Extract TDA features
        tda_features = self.extract_tda_features(X)
        
        # Extract statistical features  
        stat_features = self.extract_statistical_features(X)
        
        # Train individual models
        self.tda_model.fit(tda_features, y)
        self.statistical_model.fit(stat_features, y)
        
        # Train meta-learner on predictions
        tda_pred = self.tda_model.predict_proba(tda_features)[:, 1]
        stat_pred = self.statistical_model.predict_proba(stat_features)[:, 1]
        
        meta_features = np.column_stack([tda_pred, stat_pred])
        self.meta_learner.fit(meta_features, y)
    
    def predict(self, X):
        # Combine predictions via meta-learning
        tda_pred = self.tda_model.predict_proba(self.extract_tda_features(X))[:, 1]
        stat_pred = self.statistical_model.predict_proba(self.extract_statistical_features(X))[:, 1]
        
        meta_features = np.column_stack([tda_pred, stat_pred])
        return self.meta_learner.predict(meta_features)
```

**Expected Improvement**: +25-35% F1-score
- **Rationale**: Combines TDA's topological insights with proven statistical methods

## Strategy 5: Topological Attention for Feature Selection 🎯

### Problem with Current Approach
- Uses all TDA features equally
- No learning of which topological properties are most predictive
- Poor precision (high false positive rate)

### Proposed Solution
Learn attention weights over different topological dimensions and features:

**Implementation**:
```python
class TopologicalAttentionModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, max_dim=2):
        super().__init__()
        self.max_dim = max_dim
        
        # Separate processors for each homology dimension
        self.h0_processor = nn.Linear(6, 32)  # Connected components  
        self.h1_processor = nn.Linear(6, 32)  # Loops/cycles
        self.h2_processor = nn.Linear(6, 32)  # Voids (if applicable)
        
        # Attention mechanism over dimensions
        self.dimension_attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(32, num_heads=4)
        
        # Feature importance learning
        self.feature_attention = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(96, 48), 
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(48, 96),
            nn.Sigmoid()  # Attention weights
        )
        
        self.classifier = nn.Linear(96, 2)
    
    def forward(self, persistence_features):
        # Split features by homology dimension
        h0_features = self.h0_processor(persistence_features[:, :6])
        h1_features = self.h1_processor(persistence_features[:, 6:12])
        h2_features = self.h2_processor(persistence_features[:, 12:18])
        
        # Apply dimensional attention
        dim_features = torch.stack([h0_features, h1_features, h2_features], dim=1)
        attended_features, _ = self.dimension_attention(dim_features, dim_features, dim_features)
        
        # Flatten and apply feature attention
        flattened = attended_features.view(attended_features.size(0), -1)
        attention_weights = self.feature_attention(flattened)
        weighted_features = flattened * attention_weights
        
        return self.classifier(weighted_features)
```

**Expected Improvement**: +10-15% F1-score
- **Rationale**: Learning which topological features are most predictive should reduce false positives
