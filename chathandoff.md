Enterprise targets: <100ms latency, >10k events/sec, >20GB datasets. Gudhi 3.11+ for filtrations. Maintain full scope and streaming infra—do not simplify.

Current focus: Memory-bounded streaming distance matrix (SDM) and Čech builder with telemetry, analyzer gating, and CI artifacts.

Status highlights:

SDM: Block-tiling, early-stop (blocks/pairs/time), soft kNN cap, serial threshold enforced when soft cap > 0, overshoot telemetry (sum/max).
Čech: Bounded-degree adjacency, per-vertex locks, adjacency histogram CSV, simplex counts; deterministic artifacts under docs/performance/artifacts.
Analyzer: analyze_performance_logs.py gates on overshoot=0 in serial threshold, presence of dm_peakMB/rss_peakMB, and CSVs (accepts adj_parent_* and adj_baseline_*).
1M Čech final run completed with separate-process baseline; analyzer PASS.
Reference artifacts (1M Čech, 2025-08-14):

Directory: docs/performance/artifacts/2025-08-14_1m_cech/
Parent: run_cech_1m_t600.jsonl; adj_parent_1m_t600.csv
Baseline: baseline_cech_1m_t600.jsonl; adj_baseline_1m_t600.csv
Gate log: analyzer_1m_final.log
Parent metrics: dm_blocks=371,011; dm_edges=3,115,973; simplices=1,602,678; dm_peakMB=755.746; rss_peakMB=789.586; overshoot_sum/max=0/0; parallel_threshold=0
Baseline metrics: dm_blocks=371,930; dm_edges=3,299,630; simplices=1,604,812; dm_peakMB=752.184; rss_peakMB=791.402
Deltas (parent − baseline): Δedges=−183,657; Δsimplices=−2,134
Gate: PASS (require-csv, memory fields present, overshoot=0)
Docs updated:

docs/performance/README.md: Added “Reference artifacts (2025-08-14, 1M Čech…)”
docs/troubleshooting/RCA_Progress_Check: Added 1M checkpoint summary
Branch:

feat-memory-algos (pushed)
Next small tasks recommended:

CI: Add job to parse uploaded artifacts with analyzer (REQUIRE_CSV=1) and fail on violations. Upload artifacts to PR.
Accuracy reports: Add a small-n exact vs soft-cap accuracy report into CI (warn-only by default).
Optional: Wire staircase probes (200k/500k/1M) into CI as non-blocking nightly, persisting baselines.
What I want from you next:

Add a CI workflow step that runs the analyzer on artifacts placed in docs/performance/artifacts/2025-08-14_1m_cech and prints a compact summary in PR checks (gate must be ON with require-csv).
Then propose and add a template job to run a 200k DM-only probe on PRs (tight timeout) to catch regressions early, uploading artifacts for inspection.
Completion criteria:

New CI workflow exists, passes on current branch (gate PASS).
PR checks show analyzer summary and artifacts are uploaded.
If you need paths or metrics, use the artifacts and docs listed above.

I’ll finish wiring the remaining CI jobs and tighten gates so PRs/nightlies show clear summaries and artifacts.

checklist
Nightly staircase probes (200k/500k/1M) with analyzer gating + CSV.
Make accuracy check warn-only.
Ensure perf-probe artifacts are gated with require-CSV.
Keep unit-test analyzer optional when no JSONL exists.
actions taken
Updated ci.yml:
Added nightly schedule trigger at 02:00 UTC for staircase probes.
New job cpp-staircase-nightly:
Matrix over n=[200k, 500k, 1M].
Runs run_performance_validation.sh, analyzes with --gate --require-csv, uploads artifacts with size in the name.
cpp-accuracy-check: switched to warn-only via continue-on-error: true; failures print a warning instead of failing CI.
cpp-perf-probe: added analyzer gate step with --gate --require-csv before artifact upload.
cpp-tests: analyzer gate now conditional (only runs if JSONL exists) and without CSV requirement.
status
PRs:
1M reference analyzer gate (require-CSV) is active and uploads artifacts.
DM-only 200k probe (tight timeout) runs with analyzer gate and uploads artifacts.
Perf-probe artifacts are gated and must include adjacency CSV.
Nightly:
Staircase probes run for 200k/500k/1M, analyze with gate+require-CSV, and upload artifacts.
how to verify (optional)
Open a PR to trigger the pipeline and check:
“Analyze Reference Artifacts” job prints compact PASS summary.
“C++ DM-only Probe (200k)” passes gate and uploads sdm_200k.jsonl.
“C++ Perf Probe” shows analyzer gate with require-CSV and uploads CSV/JSONL.
Nightly artifacts will appear as cpp-staircase-nightly-<size>-artifacts.
requirements coverage
Nightly staircase probes: Done.
Accuracy warn-only by default: Done.
Perf-probe require-CSV gate: Done.
Unit-test analyzer optional/no-CSV: Done.
I’ll scan the repo to locate the existing streaming Čech harness and builder so I can add a VR mode, tests, and CI wiring in the right places. Then I’ll implement the VR variant, add a CLI switch, create unit tests, and update CI. Summarized conversation historyI'll scan the include and src directories to confirm whether a streaming VR builder exists and to identify where to add new files and update the harness to support a VR mode.

I’m fixing the CI YAML so the compact analyzer summaries run cleanly and the new VR probe job is valid; then I’ll outline what’s next.

## actions taken
- Repaired YAML indentation for all “Compact analyzer summary” steps so the inline Python runs under run: | blocks without mapping errors.
- Confirmed VR integration exists:
  - Builder: streaming_vr.hpp, streaming_vr.cpp
  - Harness VR mode: test_streaming_cech_perf.cpp supports `--mode vr` and `--epsilon`
  - Build wiring: CMakeLists.txt includes streaming_vr.cpp
- CI jobs now in place and parseable:
  - analyze-reference-artifacts (1M Čech) with gate + require-CSV + compact summaries
  - cpp-perf-probe with gate + require-CSV + compact summaries
  - cpp-dm-only-probe (200k) with gate + compact summaries
  - cpp-staircase-nightly matrix with gate + require-CSV + compact summaries
  - cpp-vr-perf-probe added, gated, with compact summaries and artifact uploads

## files changed
- ci.yml — fixed indentation for inline Python in multiple summary steps; ensured VR perf-probe job is valid.

## status checkpoint
- Analyzer gating: ON for reference/perf/staircase; CSV required only where intended.
- DM-only 200k probe: in PRs with tight timeout; uploads artifacts; gated.
- VR builder + harness mode: implemented and compiled; CI job added for quick VR probe.
- Compact analyzer summaries: printed in PR checks for all relevant jobs.

## what’s next
- Add a small-n VR parity test and a telemetry presence test (unit tests).
- Optionally include a VR path in the nightly matrix.
- Update docs with VR usage (`--mode vr`, `--epsilon`) and analyzer examples.

## quality gates
- Build/typecheck: YAML fixed; C++ unaffected by this patch. No new compile changes introduced.
- Unit tests: Existing gates unchanged; VR tests to add next.
- Analyzer: Keys required by gates unchanged; CSV requirement scoped correctly.

## requirements coverage
- CI analyzer step for committed 1M Čech artifacts with gate + require-CSV + compact summary: Done.
- 200k DM-only PR probe with gating, artifacts, and compact summary: Done.
- Nightly staircase matrix with gating and compact summaries: Done.
- VR builder + harness mode + CI VR probe job: Done (parity tests next).

Updated perf harness to serialize per-bucket pool stats
test_streaming_cech_perf.cpp
Added pool_bucket_stats_compact string (format: “arity:total/free;...”).
Emit the compact string in JSONL as pool_bucket_stats_compact.
Kept CSV unchanged (aggregate pool fields already included).
Populated fragmentation and per-bucket stats from builders
streaming_cech.cpp
streaming_vr.cpp
Compute pool_fragmentation, collect pool_bucket_stats from SimplexPool::getAllBucketStats().
Enhanced analyzer output and added a warn-only heuristic
analyze_performance_logs.py
Added pool_bucket_stats_compact to parsed fields.
Show a short preview of buckets in the “[pool] …” line.
Warn-only if fragmentation ≥ 0.95 with total_blocks ≥ 100 (no gating impact).
Strengthened VR telemetry test
test_vr_telemetry_presence.cpp
Assert presence of pool_bucket_stats_compact key in JSONL (value may be empty for tiny runs).
files changed
tests/cpp/test_streaming_cech_perf.cpp: JSONL now includes compact per-bucket pool stats.
src/cpp/algorithms/streaming_cech.cpp: BuildStats now sets pool fragmentation and per-bucket stats.
src/cpp/algorithms/streaming_vr.cpp: BuildStats now sets pool fragmentation and per-bucket stats.
scripts/analyze_performance_logs.py: Analyzer prints pool bucket preview and warns on extreme fragmentation.
tests/cpp/test_vr_telemetry_presence.cpp: Test asserts the new compact field exists.
quality gates
Lint/parse: PASS (no file-level errors detected).
Build/tests: Not run here to avoid heavy dependency setup; if you want, I can kick off a targeted build for the modified test/harness.
Requirements coverage:

Add per-bucket pool stats serialization: Done.
Keep gating unchanged; add warn-only heuristic: Done.
Show concise per-bucket preview in analyzer summaries: Done.
Extend VR telemetry test to cover new field: Done.
notes
The compact buckets string is limited to the first ~12 entries and previewed to ~60 chars in analyzer output to keep PR logs tidy.
No gating based on pool metrics has been introduced; this is visibility-only for now.
CI compact summaries already include the analyzer’s output, so the new “[pool] …, buckets=…” line will appear automatically.



Summarized conversation historyI'll scan the repo for the CI workflow and relevant files to implement the pending VR tests, CI matrix updates, and docs. Expectation: find .github/workflows/ci.yml, VR sources, test harness, and docs. Then proceed to add unit tests, wire CI, and update docs. I’ll give you a tight recap focused on the latest actions, evidence, and how it aligns with the goals.

## actions taken
- CI gating added for reference 1M Čech artifacts with require-CSV and compact summaries.
- 200k DM-only PR probe added (tight timeout), with gating and artifact uploads.
- Nightly staircase matrix (200k/500k/1M) added with gating and compact summaries.
- Streaming VR builder implemented; perf harness updated to support --mode vr/--epsilon with telemetry parity.
- New CI job cpp-vr-perf-probe added; YAML indentation errors fixed across inline Python summary steps.

## recent tool results
- Verified ci.yml includes:
  - analyze-reference-artifacts, cpp-tests, cpp-perf-probe, cpp-dm-only-probe, cpp-accuracy-check, cpp-staircase, cpp-staircase-nightly, cpp-vr-perf-probe.
  - All compact “summary” heredoc blocks are properly nested under run: | and parse cleanly.
- Confirmed analyzer gating rules and required fields in analyze_performance_logs.py (overshoot=0 when serial, dm_peakMB/rss_peakMB required, require-CSV where specified).
- Confirmed harness emits JSONL/CSV with generalized “threshold” header and VR parity.
- Streaming VR sources and harness wiring present; build targets exist.

## current state
- CI workflow parses and should run analyzer gates and compact summaries in PR checks.
- VR probe job is live; DM-only and staircase jobs are wired and gated.
- Pending: add VR-specific unit tests and (optionally) include VR in PR/nightly matrices; update docs for VR mode and analyzer expectations.

## connection to goals
- Meets the CI gating requirement for 1M Čech artifacts with require-CSV and visible compact summaries.
- Adds the 200k DM-only PR probe to catch regressions early.
- Starts Phase 3 by implementing Streaming VR and integrating it into CI.

## what’s next
- Add VR-focused unit tests (small-n parity + telemetry presence) and wire into cpp-tests.
- Optionally add a small VR probe to PR/nightly matrices.
- Update docs: VR usage (--mode vr, --epsilon), analyzer expectations, example outputs.

requirements coverage
- Reference artifacts analyzer step with require-CSV: Done.
- 200k DM-only PR probe with gating and uploads: Done.
- Compact analyzer summaries in PR checks: Done.
