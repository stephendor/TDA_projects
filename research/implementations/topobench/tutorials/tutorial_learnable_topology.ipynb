    "1. **Feature Learning**: Updates node features (`x_`) and auxiliary features (`x_aux`)\n",
    "2. **Topology Learning**: **Replaces** the original edge structure with learned edges:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   data[\"edges_index\"] = edges_dgm      # New learned topology substiturs the old one\n",
    "   data[f\"logprobs_{i}\"] = logprobs     # Variables needed to compute the loss\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Loss Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "The learned topology is optimized through the loss function in the main pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Loss computation includes both task loss and topology learning loss\n",
    "model_out = self.process_outputs(model_out=model_out, batch=batch)\n",
    "model_out = self.loss(model_out=model_out, batch=batch)  # batch contains learned edges + logprobs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables end-to-end learning where the topology is optimized jointly with the main task objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üöÄ Running the Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute the learnable topology lifting pipeline:\n",
