class DiscreteConfigurationComplexLifting(Graph2CellLifting):
    """Lift graphs to cell complexes.

    Lift graphs to cell complexes by generating the k-th discrete configuration complex D_k(G) of the graph. This is a cube complex, which is similar to a simplicial complex except each n-dimensional cell is homeomorphic to a n-dimensional cube rather than an n-dimensional simplex.

    The discrete configuration complex of order k consists of all sets of k unique edges or vertices of G, with the additional constraint that if an edge e is in a cell, then neither of the endpoints of e are in the cell. For examples of different graphs and their configuration complexes, see the tutorial.

    Note that since TopoNetx only supports cell complexes of dimension 2, if you generate a configuration complex of order k > 2 this will only produce the 2-skeleton.

    Parameters
    ----------
    k : int
        The order of the configuration complex, i.e. the number of 'agents' in a single configuration.
    preserve_edge_attr : bool, optional
        Whether to preserve edge attributes. Default is True.
    feature_aggregation : str, optional
        For a k-agent configuration, the method by which the features are aggregated. Can be "mean", "sum", or "concat". Default is "concat".
    **kwargs : dict, optional
        Additional arguments for the class.

    Notes
    -----
    The discrete configuration complex provides a way to model higher-order interactions in graphs, particularly useful for scenarios involving multiple agents or particles moving on a graph structure.
