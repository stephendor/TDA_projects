## Root Cause Analysis

### Why TDA Underperforms

1. **Feature Engineering**: Current TDA features may not capture APT patterns effectively
2. **Threshold Tuning**: Anomaly detection thresholds not optimized for this dataset
3. **Data Representation**: Network flows may not be ideal for topological analysis
4. **Scale Issues**: Very low attack rate (0.012%) challenging for TDA methods

### What's Working

1. **Infrastructure**: TDA pipeline processes real data successfully
2. **Feature Extraction**: Persistent homology features are computed correctly
3. **Validation Framework**: Honest comparison methodology established
4. **Attack Detection**: TDA does detect some attacks (27% recall)

## Improvement Strategies

### Priority 1: Precision Improvement
- **Problem**: 86% false positive rate
- **Solutions**:
  - Refine TDA feature thresholding
  - Implement multi-scale analysis
  - Combine TDA with statistical features

### Priority 2: Recall Enhancement
