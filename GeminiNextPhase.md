Phase 1: Foundation and Dataset Selection
Before we can build our advanced models, we need a solid foundation. This involves understanding our past work and selecting the right data.

Synthesize Lessons Learned: I will start by reviewing TDA_IMPROVEMENT_STRATEGY.md and A Review of Topological Data Analysis.md. This will ensure our plan is informed by the insights and challenges already identified in the project, preventing us from repeating past mistakes.
Select Top 3 Datasets: Based on the existing analysis notebooks and validation scripts, the most promising datasets appear to be UNSW-NB15, CIC-IDS-2017, and a composite APT/Netflow dataset. I will confirm their suitability by analyzing the validation results in tda_validation_outputs/ and validation/ to ensure they offer the diversity and complexity needed for robust model development.
Develop Data Ingestion Strategy: For each of the selected datasets, I will create a detailed data ingestion and preprocessing plan. This will address the challenge of handling large files by designing a streaming pipeline that reads data in manageable chunks, preprocesses them in memory, and saves them in an efficient format like Parquet. This avoids loading entire multi-gigabyte files at once.
Phase 2: Advanced TDA Feature Generation
This phase focuses on moving beyond basic persistence diagrams to create richer topological features.

Design Novel Topological Representations: I will research and prototype at least two new methods for generating topological features, moving beyond standard Vietoris-Rips filtrations. Based on current literature, promising areas include:
Multiparameter Persistence: To capture more complex feature interactions.
Witness Complex Subsampling: For efficiently approximating topology on large point clouds.
Graph-based Topology: Using graph metrics to build filtrations directly from network flow data.
Implement Scalable Feature Generation: I will implement the chosen methods within the existing src/ structure, ensuring they are optimized for performance and can be integrated into the streaming pipeline developed in Phase 1.
Phase 3: Vectorization and Model Integration
The goal here is to make our topological features compatible with deep learning models.

Establish a Vectorization Pipeline: I will use libraries like perslay and giotto-tda (found in external_repos/) to implement a standardized vectorization pipeline. This will convert the generated topological features (persistence diagrams, etc.) into machine-learning-ready formats like persistence images or landscapes.
Prototype a Deep Learning Model: I will start with a baseline deep learning architecture (e.g., a simple CNN or a Transformer-based model) to consume the vectorized topological features. The initial focus will be on creating a stable, end-to-end training and evaluation loop. The model will be built using PyTorch, leveraging the existing best_deep_tda_model.pth as a starting point if applicable.
Create an Experimentation Framework: I will structure the code to allow for easy experimentation with different TDA generation methods, vectorization techniques, and model architectures. This will enable us to systematically evaluate which combinations yield the best performance.
Phase 4: Evaluation and Iteration
Benchmark Performance: I will rigorously benchmark the entire pipeline on the three selected datasets, measuring both predictive accuracy and computational performance (time and memory usage).
Analyze and Refine: Based on the benchmark results, I will identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement, iterating on the TDA methods, vectorization parameters, and model architecture to optimize performance.
