print("=" * 80)

print("\n1. BASELINE DETECTOR ANALYSIS:")
print("-" * 50)

# Baseline approach
print("Baseline APTDetector:")
print("- Uses single IsolationForest with contamination=0.1 (10%)")
print("- StandardScaler for preprocessing")
print("- Simple topological features from PH + Mapper")
print("- Mapper: 15 intervals, 0.4 overlap")
print("- Unsupervised anomaly detection only")
print("- Single decision threshold")

print("\n2. IMPROVED DETECTOR CHANGES:")
print("-" * 50)

print("Parameter Changes:")
print("- anomaly_threshold: 0.1 → 0.05 (more sensitive)")
print("- mapper_intervals: 15 → 20 (higher resolution)")
print("- mapper_overlap: 0.4 → 0.5 (more overlap)")
print("- min_persistence: 0.01 → 0.001 (more detail)")

print("\nArchitectural Changes:")
print("- StandardScaler → RobustScaler (outlier handling)")
print("- Single detector → Ensemble of 3 IsolationForests")
print("- Added RandomForestClassifier for supervised learning")
print("- Enhanced feature extraction (more statistical features)")
print("- Adaptive thresholding")
print("- Temporal smoothing")

print("\n3. THEORETICAL JUSTIFICATION:")
print("-" * 50)

print("✅ GOOD IDEAS:")
print("- Ensemble methods generally improve robustness")
print("- RobustScaler better for data with outliers")
print("- More Mapper resolution could capture finer patterns")
print("- Enhanced statistical features add information")
print("- Adaptive thresholding could help with varying data")

print("\n❌ POTENTIAL PROBLEMS:")
print("- More complexity without validation on real data")
print("- Ensemble might overfit to training data")
print("- Too many features could cause curse of dimensionality")
print("- Adaptive threshold might be unstable")
print("- Mixed supervised/unsupervised approach is complex")

print("\n4. ACTUAL FAILURE ANALYSIS:")
print("-" * 50)

print("From debugging output, the improved detector:")
print("- Predicts ALL samples as APT (probability ~0.68)")
print("- Shows no discrimination between normal/APT data")
print("- Suggests fundamental threshold or feature issues")

print("\nPossible root causes:")
print("1. Feature extraction produces similar values for all samples")
print("2. Ensemble voting is biased toward positive predictions")
print("3. Adaptive threshold calculation is broken")
print("4. Scaling issues with RobustScaler")
print("5. Complex feature engineering obscures signal")

print("\n5. IS THIS APPROACH WORTH FIXING?")
print("-" * 50)

print("Arguments FOR fixing:")
print("✅ Ensemble methods are theoretically sound")
print("✅ Better feature engineering could help")
print("✅ Some ideas (RobustScaler) are good practices")

print("\nArguments AGAINST fixing:")
print("❌ Baseline already performs poorly (55-82%)")
print("❌ Complex approach failed dramatically")
print("❌ No clear theoretical advantage for TDA + ensemble")
print("❌ Time could be better spent elsewhere")

print("\n6. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES:")
print("-" * 50)

print("Instead of fixing the complex detector:")
print("1. Improve the baseline detector:")
print("   - Better hyperparameter tuning")
print("   - Different anomaly detection algorithms")
print("   - Feature selection/engineering")

print("\n2. Different algorithmic approach:")
print("   - Deep learning (autoencoders for anomaly detection)")
print("   - Time series analysis methods")
print("   - Graph-based approaches")
print("   - Traditional ML with better features")

print("\n3. Focus on data quality:")
print("   - Better synthetic data generation")
print("   - Real-world data collection")
print("   - Feature engineering based on domain knowledge")

print("\n7. RECOMMENDATION:")
print("-" * 50)

print("VERDICT: The improved detector approach is NOT worth fixing.")
print("\nReasons:")
print("1. The baseline is already problematic (~55-82% accuracy)")
print("2. The 'improvement' made things significantly worse")
print("3. The approach is overly complex without clear benefit")
print("4. Time would be better spent on:")
print("   - Understanding why baseline performs poorly")
print("   - Trying completely different approaches")
print("   - Focusing on other project priorities (financial modules)")

print("\nThe fundamental issue may be that TDA methods are not")
print("well-suited for this type of anomaly detection task,")
print("or that the synthetic data doesn't capture real APT patterns.")
