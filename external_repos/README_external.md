# External Repositories and References

This directory contains external code repositories and implementations for learning and reference purposes. These are **NOT** part of our core platform but provide proven patterns and working examples.

## Repository Structure

```
external_repos/
├── tda_cybersecurity_papers/     # Paper implementations and reproductions
├── gudhi_examples/               # GUDHI library examples and tutorials  
├── scikit_tda_demos/            # Scikit-TDA demonstrations and workflows
├── collins_iot_reproduction/    # Specific Collins et al. (2020) reproduction
└── persistence_image_examples/  # Persistence image processing examples
```

## Usage Guidelines

### ✅ **DO:**
- Reference code patterns and implementation strategies
- Extract useful utility functions and adapt to our codebase
- Learn from proven methodological approaches
- Compare our implementations against established benchmarks
- Document what we learned from each external source

### ❌ **DON'T:**
- Directly copy/paste code without understanding
- Mix external code directly into our `src/` directory
- Modify external repositories (treat as read-only references)
- Use as primary development workspace (use `notebooks/` for experimentation)

## Integration with Main Project

- **Learning**: Study external implementations in `notebooks/`
- **Adaptation**: Create new methods in `src/` inspired by external patterns
- **Validation**: Compare our results against external benchmarks
- **Documentation**: Reference external sources in our validation reports
