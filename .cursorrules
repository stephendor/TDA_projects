# TDA Development Rules

## TDA Algorithm Expert Mode
When working on TDA algorithms, focus on:
- Implementing Vietoris-Rips, Alpha Complex, ÄŒech, and DTM filtrations
- Optimizing C++23 code with SIMD vectorization
- Ensuring mathematical correctness of topological algorithms
- Performance optimization for 1M+ points in <60 seconds

## Performance Profiler Mode
When optimizing performance, focus on:
- SIMD vectorization analysis and implementation
- Memory layout optimization (SoA vs AoS patterns)
- Cache efficiency and spatial locality
- Benchmarking and profiling TDA operations
