# Filtration experiments and vector_stack progress analysis (2025-08-10 12:48Z)

_**User**_

I want you to examine teh context file GPT5THOUGHTS and compare it with our progress on the filtration experiments and vector_stack plans. How realistic is it to keep pushing at this method to get suitably hight scores? Where and how can we best do so? 

---

_**Assistant**_

Gathering the contents of the relevant experiment and thoughts files to ground the comparative analysis. Reading existing experiment analysis and plan files to compare current progress with the aspirational protocol. Reading multi attack TDA analysis to assess current progress vs target goals. Reading filtration experiment planning logs for comparison. Reading filtration experiment chat log for current progress evidence. Task: Compare aspirational protocol in GPT5THOUGHTS vs current filtration + vector_stack progress and judge realism and best leverage points.

## Snapshot Comparison

Aspirational targets (GPT5THOUGHTS standout): Recall ≥95%, Precision ≥97%, AUC ≥0.98 on realistic (chronological / zero‑day) splits.

Current reality (latest vector_stack fast passes):
- PR AUC ≈ 0.78–0.81
- ROC AUC ≈ 0.65–0.70 (core weakness)
- Training slow (LR ~14 min, SVM >11 min, SVM not converged)
- Feature space: ~24–25K dims after pruning; SW projections dominate (>50%+), many near-zero/flat columns
- Filtration variant plan drafted (dtm / sparse) but NOT yet executed (only baseline directory noted)
- Leakage diagnostics framework added but run outcome for leakage flags not yet summarized here (must confirm)

Conclusion: We are far below “standout” thresholds; the binding constraint is weak rank separation (low ROC AUC), not solver tuning. Continuing to micro-tune solvers will not bridge a >0.25 ROC AUC gap. Representation + data validation must lead.

## Realism Assessment

Reaching AUC ~0.98 with current single-dataset, modest sample size, and mostly shallow summary features is unlikely without:
1. Better point cloud construction capturing richer geometry (temporal + relational structure, not just aggregated windows).
2. More discriminative multi-scale topological signals (currently many barren/constant blocks).
3. Verified clean temporal split with sufficient simultaneous benign/attack overlap (avoid artificial class separability or dilution).
4. Possibly additional modalities or larger dataset.

Short-term realistic target after focused improvements: ROC AUC 0.78–0.82, PR AUC 0.84–0.87 (if prevalence high). If after 2–3 representation iterations ROC AUC stays <0.75, pivot or re-extract data.

## Key Bottlenecks

1. Feature Signal Dilution: Huge SW block overshadowing small, largely zero-information persistence blocks → gradient noise & slow convergence.
2. Flat / Constant Columns: Thousands of near-zero variance dimensions still present (even after zero variance prune).
3. Limited Topological Diversity: Only one filtration mode executed (standard). No DTM (density-aware) or sparse variants yet to amplify meaningful cycles.
4. Potential Temporal/Data Integrity Uncertainty: Must inspect leakage diagnostics output (e.g., signature overlap, time/label correlation).
5. Imbalanced Block Scaling: Per-block z-scoring may not counter extreme sparsity → consider adaptive scaling or block weighting.
6. Lack of Multi-Resolution Fusion: Single resolution choices for landscapes/images; no coarse+fine fusion to stabilize H1/H2 signals.
7. Mapper Underutilization: Mapper features present but all zero importances—likely too coarse or ill-configured on current point cloud.

## Highest-Leverage Next Moves (Ranked)

1. Hard Leakage Verification (Stop if Fail):
   - Inspect latest diagnostics.json leakage_checks; if any flag (signature overlap, anomalous time-label correlation) → rebuild splits before anything else.
2. Execute Filtration Variant Matrix (dtm k=10, sparse 10):
   - Measure ΔPR & ΔROC + feature_dim/time deltas.
   - Abort if both fail criteria (per plan).
3. Block-Level Feature Audit & Pruning:
   - Compute per-block (SW, landscapes, images, betti, mapper, kernel) mean absolute variance & sparsity.
   - Drop/threshold entire sub-blocks contributing <ε variance (e.g., keep top k blocks by cross-validated permutation importance).
4. Rebalance Representation:
   - Reduce SW angles (e.g., 48→24) unless SW contributes clear lift; reclaim budget for:
     - Additional persistence image resolutions (e.g., 16×16 + 48×48) or
     - Persistence silhouettes / landscapes with different k-levels.
5. Introduce Density-Aware & Sparse Filtrations:
   - DTM may enhance H1 loops in cluttered point clouds.
   - Sparse Rips may cut cost without accuracy loss; if PASS by rules, adopt to accelerate iteration.
6. Improve Point Cloud Construction:
   - Add temporal embedding (e.g., time-lag coordinates) and protocol-layer mixing to differentiate coordinated behaviors.
   - Normalize per-session before union to prevent scale dominance.
7. Feature Compression (Target SW Block):
   - Apply TruncatedSVD (retain 95% variance) ONLY to SW block → concatenate reduced components with other blocks.
   - Re-run to check ROC AUC lift + faster convergence.
8. Model Layer Improvements (After Representation Gain):
   - Elastic Net LR (l1_ratio ~0.2–0.4) for structured sparsity.
   - LightGBM/HistGBDT with early stopping (already decent anchor—tune learning_rate, num_leaves).
   - Only then consider shallow neural net on persistence images (if image block revived).
9. Calibration Re-Enable (Selective):
   - After ROC AUC improves, calibrate best-performing model only (avoid 3× overhead) to get stable Precision@Recall.

## Go / No-Go Criteria

Proceed (GO) if after Steps 1–5:
- ROC AUC ≥ 0.75 AND shows ≥ +0.05 absolute lift vs current baseline
- Pruned/variant pipeline reduces training wall time ≥25% OR improves PR AUC ≥0.005.

Reassess (HOLD) if:
- ROC AUC stuck 0.70–0.74 after filtration + pruning + SVD.

Pivot (NO-GO) if:
- Leakage detected OR ROC AUC <0.70 still after improvements → revisit data generation, add modalities, or refine labeling.

## Minimal Immediate Action Bundle (One Iteration Cycle)

1. Run dtm k=10 & sparse 10.
2. Extract block-level variance/sparsity stats, prune SW angles to 24, add SVD( SW → 300 comps).
3. Fit Elastic Net LR + LightGBM (no calibration) and log ROC/PR deltas.
4. Decide on continuing with expanded filtration grid or pivot.

## Risks & Mitigations

- Risk: Over-pruning kills small but real signals → Mitigate by retaining validation of full vs pruned pipeline once before committing.
- Risk: DTM increases compute time without gain → Early abort per matrix rules.
- Risk: SVD introduces leakage (fit on full dataset) → Ensure fit only on train split; persist components.

## Why “Keep Pushing” Still Makes Sense (Conditionally)

We have not yet:
- Explored alternative filtrations (planned but unexecuted).
- Properly rebalanced feature blocks.
- Applied dimensionality reduction in a targeted manner.
- Validated mapper contribution (maybe misconfigured rather than useless).

These are foundational representation steps—cheap relative to collecting a new dataset. So one disciplined iteration cycle is warranted before larger pivots.

## Summary Answer

It’s not realistic to jump from ROC AUC ~0.67 to 0.98 via solver tweaks; the path must go through stronger topological signal extraction and aggressive elimination of dead features. One more tightly-scoped representation improvement cycle (filtration variants + block pruning + SW compression + leakage confirmation) is justified. If ROC AUC does not clear ~0.75 after that, pause and reassess data sources or broaden modalities.

Let me know if you want me to (a) inspect the latest diagnostics for leakage now, (b) script the filtration variant runs, or (c) implement block-level variance + SVD compression next. Just say which and I’ll execute.

Context Resume (TDA Cyber Attack Detection – Filtration Experiment Continuation)

Baseline (run: validation/vector_stack_outputs/20250810_031323):
- SW angles: 48 (strategy=golden, hash=8667986c9511b4c)
- Rips mode: standard
- Metrics (LR): PR AUC 0.8177, ROC AUC 0.7105, Best F1 0.8567, Brier 0.1767, ECE 0.0643
- Metrics (GBT): PR AUC 0.8032, ROC AUC 0.6739
- diagnostics.json currently lacks filtration_recompute (standard mode path produced none)

Recent Code Change:
- File updated: extract_vector_stack.py
- Added guaranteed diagnostics['filtration_recompute'] block with full schema even if no recompute:
  Keys: attempted_count, success_count, skipped_no_pointcloud, skipped_no_gudhi, failed_exception, failed_empty, rips_recompute_time_sec, total_points_in, total_points_after_subsample, mean_points_in, mean_points_after_subsample, mode, params{dtm_k,sparse_param}
- Fixed ablation loop indentation and static analysis warnings.
- Codacy analysis: clean (no issues).

Objective Now (Phase 1 Filtration Variants):
1. Run dtm variant: --rips-mode dtm --dtm-k 10
2. Run sparse variant: --rips-mode sparse --rips-sparse-param 10
3. Collect each run’s:
   - results/metrics.json and metrics_with_flags.json
   - results/diagnostics.json (verify filtration_recompute populated)
4. Compute deltas vs baseline using enhancement_delta_eval.py (include filtration_recompute section in output).
5. Early abort rule: If BOTH variants have ΔPR_AUC < +0.003 AND train_time_ratio > 1.10 (LR), stop further k/param sweeps.
6. Classification:
   - PASS: ΔPR_AUC ≥ +0.005 AND train_time ≤1.25× baseline
   - MARGINAL: +0.003–0.0049 (repeat once to confirm)
   - Sparse efficiency accept (even with small PR drop): PR drop <0.003 AND (time ≤0.75× OR feature_dim ≤0.8×)
   - FAIL otherwise
7. If any PASS/MARGINAL:
   - Additional dtm k sweep: 5, 20
   - Additional sparse param sweep: 5, 20
8. Record all outcomes in 20250810_filtration_experiment_plan.md (append) and produce enhancement delta JSONs (naming pattern: enhancement_eval_<timestamp>.json).
9. If all FAIL → add concise entry to METHODOLOGY_GRAVEYARD.md and pivot (angle reduction or representation refinement).

Integrity / Risk Checks:
- Confirm gudhi imported (_HAS_GUDHI True)
- filtration_recompute.mean_points_after_subsample meaningful (sparse shrink ratio)
- Monitor H1 interval counts (avoid over-pruning)
- Abort dtm if rips_recompute_time_sec / baseline_lr_train_time > 1.5×

What I Need You (New Chat) To Do First:
A. Run dtm k=10 and sparse param=10 variants with updated script.
B. Show: (i) LR & GBT metrics, (ii) filtration_recompute block, (iii) time ratios vs baseline (train_time_sec), (iv) feature_dim ratio (post_prune_feature_dim).
C. Produce delta evaluation outputs and classify each variant per criteria.
D. Decide whether to proceed with expanded sweeps or abort.

Baseline Reference Values to Compare Against:
- Baseline LR train_time_sec: 1045.223269315
- Baseline post_prune_feature_dim: 22618
- Baseline manifest_hash present in diagnostics.json (use to ensure variant hash changes with mode)

Success Output for This Continuation:
Provide a concise summary table (variant, ΔPR_AUC, ΔROC_AUC, ΔBrier, train_time_ratio, feature_dim_ratio, decision PASS/MARGINAL/FAIL/EFFICIENCY) plus raw filtration_recompute blocks.

Proceed now with step A unless blocked; don’t re-edit code unless diagnostics missing.

- Rips mode: standard
- Manifest hash: 97de5c7493c154bbe07c990821ad7996dcace6fd1f78c4c48101a76512422649
Baseline Metrics (Logistic Regression):
- PR AUC: 0.8177
- ROC AUC: 0.7105
- Best F1: 0.8567
- Brier: 0.1767
- ECE: 0.0643

- ROC AUC: 0.6739
Baseline Diagnostics Key Values:
- lr_train_time_sec: 1045.223269315
- post_prune_feature_dim: 22618
- filtration_recompute: (absent previously; now enforced)
- SW angles hash: 8667986c9511b4c
- Seeds fixed (deterministic requirement)

Recent Code Enhancement:
- extract_vector_stack.py now always emits diagnostics['filtration_recompute'] with schema:
  attempted_count, success_count, skipped_no_pointcloud, skipped_no_gudhi, failed_exception, failed_empty,
  rips_recompute_time_sec, total_points_in, total_points_after_subsample, mean_points_in, mean_points_after_subsample,
  mode, params{dtm_k,sparse_param}
- Added ablation loop fix, static analysis clean (Codacy OK)
- Leakage diagnostics framework already present (potential_leakage_flag etc.)

Objective (Phase 1 Filtration Variants):
1. Run DTM variant:
   --rips-mode dtm --dtm-k 10
2. Run Sparse variant:
   --rips-mode sparse --rips-sparse-param 10
3. Capture per run:
   - metrics.json, metrics_with_flags.json
   - diagnostics.json (must include: filtration_recompute, leakage_checks, block-level feature dim, post_prune_feature_dim, manifest_hash, sw_angles_hash)
   - Verify H0/H1/H2 persistence interval counts present (or counts per block if aggregated)
4. Compute deltas vs baseline using enhancement_delta_eval.py:
   Required delta fields: ΔPR_AUC, ΔROC_AUC, ΔBrier, ΔECE, train_time_ratio (LR), feature_dim_ratio, persistence_block_presence deltas (if available), rips_recompute_time_sec, mean_points_after_subsample, sparse shrink ratio (total_points_after_subsample / total_points_in)
5. Integrity Gate (hard stop if any true):
   - diagnostics.leakage_checks.potential_leakage_flag == true
   - filtration_recompute.failed_exception > 0 OR failed_empty > 0
   - success_count == 0 while attempted_count > 0
6. Early Abort Rule (performance-based):
   - If BOTH dtm(10) and sparse(10):
     ΔPR_AUC < +0.003 AND lr train_time_ratio > 1.10 → abort matrix, record FAIL outcomes.
7. Classification:
   - PASS: ΔPR_AUC ≥ +0.005 AND train_time_ratio ≤ 1.25
   - MARGINAL: +0.003 ≤ ΔPR_AUC < +0.005 (repeat variant ONCE to confirm; accept higher result)
   - SPARSE EFFICIENCY PASS: (PR drop < 0.003) AND (train_time_ratio ≤ 0.75 OR feature_dim_ratio ≤ 0.80)
   - FAIL: otherwise
8. Expansion Logic (only if at least one PASS or MARGINAL or Sparse Efficiency Pass):
   - Additional DTM k: 5, 20
   - Additional Sparse params: 5, 20
9. Post-Evaluation:
   - Produce enhancement_eval_<timestamp>.json per variant (include raw filtration_recompute + decision + baseline reference).
   - Append concise outcome entries to `20250810_filtration_experiment_plan.md`
10. Global Failure Path:
   - If all tested variants FAIL (no marginal/efficiency pass) → append rationale to `METHODOLOGY_GRAVEYARD.md` and pivot to representation refinement (SW angle reduction + SW SVD compression) in next cycle.

Additional Monitoring & Checks:
- Confirm _HAS_GUDHI True in diagnostics; if False → classify variant as SKIPPED (document).
- Ensure manifest_hash changes (should incorporate filtration mode param hashing). If unchanged except for mode (unexpected) → flag potential hashing oversight.
- Track H1 count changes: large drop (>40%) may indicate over-aggressive sparsification → note caution even if metrics lift.
- Ensure no statistical proxies introduced (only legitimate topological features).
- Seeds constant across variants (record seed in delta file).

Potential Efficiency Aid (ONLY if both initial variants FAIL due to time, not accuracy):
- Apply SW block dimensionality compression (TruncatedSVD) in separate branch AFTER documenting pure filtration results (not part of current Phase 1).

Required Final Output for This Continuation:
Provide summary table with columns:
variant | mode_param | ΔPR_AUC | ΔROC_AUC | ΔBrier | train_time_ratio | feature_dim_ratio | h1_interval_ratio | decision
Followed by raw filtration_recompute sections verbatim and any leakage_checks block if potential_leakage_flag true (else abbreviated OK).

Execution Steps (do in order):
A. Run DTM k=10 variant
B. Run Sparse param=10 variant
C. Generate delta JSONs
D. Apply classification & early abort logic
E. If proceed → outline next sweep set; if abort → state pivot recommendation

Abort Conditions (repeated for emphasis):
- Any leakage flag
- Both initial variants underperform threshold with time inflation
- Filtration recomputation failures

DO FIRST NOW:
Execute steps A & B; do not modify code unless diagnostics schema missing or filtration_recompute malformed.
