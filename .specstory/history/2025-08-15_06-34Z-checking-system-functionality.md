Does this appear to be running properly:

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the terminal output you've shared, **no, this does not appear to be running properly**. There are several clear issues:

## Problems Identified:

1. **Command Truncation**: The command appears to be cut off mid-execution, ending with `echo 'OK'ne.ReallyRender(RenderData renderData, String default>> or)`

2. **PowerShell Error**: The output shows PowerShell-specific errors that shouldn't appear in a Linux bash environment:
   - `Microsoft.PowerShell.PSConsoleReadLine.ForceRender()`
   - `Microsoft.PowerShell.PSConsoleReadLine.InputLoop()`
   - `Microsoft.PowerShell.PSConsoleReadLine.ReadLine()`

3. **Unexpected Output**: The command should be running a C++ TDA performance test, but instead it's showing PowerShell console errors.

## What Should Happen:

The command should execute the `test_streaming_cech_perf` binary with Vietoris-Rips mode on 100,000 points in 3D, and you should see:
- Performance metrics output
- JSON results being written to the specified files
- Clean completion with "OK" message

## Likely Causes:

1. **Terminal Environment Issue**: There might be a PowerShell session mixed with bash
2. **Command Corruption**: The command line got corrupted during input
3. **Terminal State**: The terminal might be in an inconsistent state

## Recommended Actions:

1. **Clear the terminal** and try again with a clean command
2. **Verify you're in bash** (not PowerShell)
3. **Run the command step by step** to isolate the issue
4. **Check if the binary exists** at the expected path

Would you like me to help you troubleshoot this further or provide a corrected version of the command?
