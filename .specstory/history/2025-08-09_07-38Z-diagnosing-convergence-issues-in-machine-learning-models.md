# Diagnosing Convergence Issues in Machine Learning Models (2025-08-09 07:38Z)

_**User**_

Okay, unfortunately our most recent run was interrupted by another extension reloading VS Code. However there are some result files available for analysis. We will need to rerun the vector_stack process using the experiment orchestrator again. Note that Liblinear and SVM both failed to converge again and they took an immense amount of time to do so. Liblinear I think was over an hour and SVM had not fully converged when it was closed after two hours. So we need to investigate these things a bit more. i.e improve performance in terms of convergence and speed. This may be a deeper issue with sparseness of the homology data. Let's get ourselves back up to speed with what happened in this run first.

---

_**Assistant**_

Gathering code context for vector stack orchestration, solver settings, and last run log to accurately summarize the interrupted run and diagnose convergence issues. Reading vector_stack module and extraction script to understand feature sparsity and solver configuration. Searching for experiment orchestrator and solver configuration related to logistic regression, linear SVM, liblinear. Reading orchestrator script to understand pipeline and classifier settings. Searching extract_vector_stack script for classifier implementations and solver settings. Listing validation directory to locate extract_vector_stack.py. Reading extract_vector_stack.py for classifier configuration. Recapping the interrupted run and setting up a focused plan to diagnose + fix LR/SVM convergence issues.

## Checklist
- Summarize current metrics artifacts
- Identify anomalies (confusion matrices, class balance hints)
- Compute / recall expected feature dimensionality & sparsity factors
- Diagnose likely root causes of very slow / non‑convergence
- Recommend concrete diagnostics to add for next rerun
- Propose faster rerun parameter set (without sacrificing evaluation integrity)
- Outline deeper remediation paths (if sparsity / class imbalance confirmed)

## 1. What we have (metrics_with_flags.json excerpt)
Models (all marked non‑degradation):
- Logistic Regression: PR-AUC 0.7763, ROC-AUC 0.6476, best F1 0.8316
- Linear SVM: PR-AUC 0.7936, ROC-AUC 0.6931, best F1 0.8611
- Gradient Boosted Trees: PR-AUC 0.8056, ROC-AUC 0.6729, best F1 0.8419 (feature importances saved)

Anomaly: Confusion matrices serialized as something like [[934], []] instead of a normal 2×2 (same for others). That strongly suggests one of:
1. Only one class present in y_test (scikit returns 1×1 matrix) and our serialization logic inadvertently appended an empty second row somewhere upstream, or
2. Data corruption / partial write during interruption.

If y_test truly had a single class, ROC-AUC should raise an exception—so more likely the file got truncated mid-write or the confusion matrix object got mutated (less likely). We need to re-derive confusion matrices on rerun to confirm.

## 2. Expected vector stack feature dimensionality
Per homology dimension (H0, H1):
- Landscapes: levels=3, resolutions=(100,300) → 3*(100+300)=1200
- Persistence Images: (16×16 + 32×32)=256+1024=1280
- Betti curve: 300
- SW projections: angles=48 (or 32 earlier), resolution=300 → 48*300=14,400
- Kernel small/large: 32 + 32 = 64
Subtotal per dim ≈ 17,244; for two dims ≈ 34,488 dense features.

This size is moderate, but:
- Many blocks (landscapes/images/betti) contain large low-variance or near-zero regions.
- SW projection block dominates (≈ 83% of features), potentially poorly scaled despite per-block z-score (because internal distributions can be very flat).

## 3. Likely causes of very slow convergence
1. Calibration multiplies cost: CalibratedClassifierCV with 3-fold CV trains logistic regression (and SVM) 3 extra times each. With max_iter=8000 and possible early plateaus, this alone can push runtime >1h if solver struggles.
2. L1 penalty (lr_penalty=l1) with saga on moderately high-dimensional, low-signal blocks tends to produce many near-zero coefficient updates → slow shrinkage, especially with tolerance 1e-3 if gradients are tiny.
3. Class imbalance: If attack rate is low, class_weight='balanced' inflates minority gradients; if combined with only a handful of positive samples per fold, variance increases iteration counts.
4. LinearSVC default dual=True may be suboptimal depending on n_samples vs n_features (if n_samples >> n_features, dual=False is faster; if n_features >> n_samples, dual=True is ok—but we need counts).
5. Potential quasi-collinearity: SW + images + landscapes can yield highly correlated columns making optimization slower.
6. No feature pruning of constant / near-constant columns (e.g., empty landscapes for sparse diagrams) wastes cycles.
7. Interrupted run may have been in calibration phase (worst-case repeated fits).

## 4. Immediate diagnostics to add before next run
(We should instrument `extract_vector_stack.py` in next step.)
Capture and persist:
- n_samples_train, n_samples_test, class counts (both classes) and attack_rate.
- Per-model training wall time and (for LR) n_iter_ (from estimator or from each CV fold).
- Convergence flags: whether n_iter_ hit max_iter (store boolean).
- SVM dual/primal selection and n_iter_ (LinearSVC exposes n_iter_ as an array).
- Count of zero-variance features after normalization (fast: (X_train.std(axis=0)==0).sum()).
- Mean / median absolute coefficient magnitude after LR fit (sanity of shrinkage).
- Optional: For each block span, fraction of zero entries across train set (sparsity profile).

## 5. Fast rerun parameter adjustments (exploratory)
Primary goal: Obtain clean metrics + convergence telemetry fast, not final peak performance.

Suggested run (tier 1):
- Disable calibration temporarily (--no-calibration) to remove 3× overhead.
- Logistic Regression: switch penalty to l2 for speed OR keep l1 but relax max_iter and increase tol.
  - Option A (speed baseline): penalty=l2, max_iter=2000, tol=5e-3
  - Option B (retain sparsity): penalty=l1, max_iter=4000, tol=2e-3
- Reduce SW angles from 48 -> 32 for this diagnostic pass (if orchestrator allows via --sw-angles 32) to drop ~4800 features (~14% reduction).
- Linear SVM: add logic to set dual = (n_samples < n_features). If n_samples >> n_features, set dual=False. Raise tol to 1e-3 (default) or 2e-3.
- (Optionally) Skip ablations (--skip-ablations) until convergence instrumentation verified.
- Keep gradient boosted trees unchanged (serves as performance anchor).

Tier 2 (after instrumentation):
- Implement zero-variance (or near-zero variance) feature pruning prior to fitting LR/SVM (simple mask). Persist mask for test transform.
- Consider elasticnet (l1_ratio=0.3) with saga for balanced sparsity/performance.
- If still slow, replace LinearSVC with SGDClassifier(loss='hinge', penalty='l2', class_weight='balanced', early_stopping=True) for a stochastic baseline.

## 6. Root cause hypotheses to validate
| Hypothesis | Evidence Needed | Action if True |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Single-class test split (bad split) | Recompute class counts | Fix manifest splitting logic |
| Extreme imbalance | Attack rate metrics | Threshold tuning / reweighting stable |
| Overly strict solver settings | n_iter_ == max_iter | Relax tol, reduce features |
| Redundant high-correlation blocks | Block-level variance & correlation sample | Potential dimensionality reduction (PCA on SW curves only) |
| Many constant / zero columns | Zero-variance count | Prune before fit |

## 7. Proposed next concrete steps
1. Add instrumentation (as above) to extract script (and optionally orchestrator) before rerun.
2. Rerun orchestrator with fast diagnostic parameter set:  
   python `experiment_orchestrator.py` --sw-angles 32 --lr-penalty l2 --lr-max-iter 2000 --svm-max-iter 4000 --baseline-pr 0.706 --no-calibration --skip-ablations
3. Review new metrics + convergence telemetry.
4. Decide whether to (a) re-enable calibration and (b) restore angles after confirming stability.

(If you want, I can implement the instrumentation patch next.)

## 8. Deeper remediation (only after confirming diagnostics)
- Block-wise adaptive pruning: Remove blocks whose normalized mean absolute value < tiny threshold across train (likely empty signal).
- SW downsampling: Use fewer angles + smaller resolution (e.g., 24 angles × 200) if minimal PR-AUC impact.
- Replace dense float arrays with sparse COO for predominantly zero blocks (if measured sparsity >70%) and use solvers supporting sparse input (saga does).
- Lightweight dimensionality reduction (TruncatedSVD) on SW portion only, retaining 95% variance, then concatenate other blocks.

## 9. Quick interpretation of current metrics quality
PR-AUC ~0.78–0.81 across models already clears baseline 0.706 (no degradation). So performance is acceptable; bottleneck is training efficiency & reliability, not accuracy regression.

## 10. Recommendation
Proceed with instrumentation + fast rerun before changing core feature construction. Avoid premature structural pruning until we have empirical sparsity / variance stats.

Let me know and I can immediately apply the instrumentation edits and trigger the new run. Would you like me to implement the patch now?

Check the terminal, check for codacy and then redo the fast run

Collecting current terminal outputs to ensure no conflicting processes before launching a new fast diagnostic run. Running fast diagnostic orchestrator experiment with reduced angles and iterations. Listing latest experiment run directory and inspecting logs to diagnose why orchestrated fast run failed before producing outputs. Updating orchestrator to export PYTHONPATH so extract script can import src package, then rerunning fast experiment. 
```

```
Running Codacy analysis on modified orchestrator file per rules. Analyzing the updated orchestrator file with Codacy CLI for quality issues. Re-running fast experiment after PYTHONPATH fix. Locate new vector_stack_outputs directory for this run and inspect metrics_with_flags.json. Have the full context; ready to proceed. Suggested next actions (pick any to start):

1. Convergence instrumentation: add per-model n_iter_, elapsed times, solver convergence flags, feature count, zero-variance counts; persist to diagnostics.json.
2. Zero-/near-zero variance pruning: compute variance vector, drop columns below epsilon, save mask (np.save) + report dimensionality reduction.
3. SVM dual/primal heuristic: choose dual=(n_samples < n_features) else False; log decision.
4. Calibration re-introduction: after confirming stable convergence, rerun with selective (only best model) calibration to control runtime.
5. Confusion matrix anomaly check: add assertion that each confusion matrix is 2x2; log if not.

Say which one you want first (or all), and I’ll implement immediately.

Implemented all requested enhancements: convergence instrumentation, zero-variance pruning (530 features removed; near-zero count logged), SVM dual heuristic, confusion matrix safeguard, diagnostics export, and optional calibration controls. Added diagnostics.json with per-model timing, iteration counts, pruning info, and topology metadata. Fixed spans serialization and ensured script runs (fast run succeeded). Ran Codacy analysis on the modified file (clean).

Key diagnostics (fast run, no calibration, pruned):
- Original features: 24888 -> 24358 after pruning 530 zero-variance
- LR: n_iter=689 (converged within 2000), train_time≈859s
- Linear SVM: dual=True (n_samples < n_features), hit max_iter=4000 (needs more for convergence), train_time≈683s
- GBT: train_time≈317s
- Near-zero variance (<1e-8) features: 7237 (candidates for further pruning threshold if desired)

Next optional steps:
1. Increase SVM max_iter or switch penalty tuning; or add early stop when decision function stabilizes.
2. Introduce near-zero variance pruning with small threshold (e.g., 1e-6) to cut 7K low-information dims.
3. Re-enable calibration only for LR after confirming stability (--calibrate-best-only).
4. Add iteration/time logging per 100 iters (requires partial_fit alternative or warm-start loop).

Let me know which follow-up you want and I’ll implement.

What are the AUC values and general output like for these most recent runs? Is this still a promising avenue for tuning or do we need to step back and think more carefully before proceeding?

---

_**Assistant**_

AUC summary (latest run):
- Logistic Regression: PR AUC 0.780, ROC AUC 0.651
- Linear SVM: PR AUC 0.801, ROC AUC 0.697
- Gradient Boosted Trees: PR AUC 0.805, ROC AUC 0.669

Observations:
- PR AUC hovers ~0.80 across models; with positive class prevalence ≈0.70, the lift over a random (prevalence) baseline is modest (~+0.10 absolute).
- ROC AUC values (0.65–0.70) indicate weak rank separation; this ceiling—not solver choice—is now the main bottleneck.
- SVM default-threshold confusion matrix is pathological (almost all positives predicted negative except 2 TPs) — confirms raw decision function is poorly scaled; threshold tuning rescues F1, so probability/score calibration or feature scaling issues remain.
- GBT slightly leads PR AUC but also shows high FP rate at best-F1 threshold (TN 176 vs FP 1085), suggesting aggressive recall-driven threshold.

Promising to keep tuning? Marginal if we only tweak solvers. Low ROC AUC signals feature-level or label-quality limitations; further micro-optimizing convergence will likely yield diminishing returns.

Recommend step-back actions before deeper tuning:
1. Enhance feature quality: investigate redundancy (run near-zero variance pruning, correlation clustering) and possibly reparameterize persistence images/landscapes.
2. Verify temporal / data leakage rigorously (ensure no subtle overlap inflating PR AUC while ROC stays low).
3. Calibrate scores (Platt/Isotonic) on a clean validation split—may stabilize threshold behavior, especially for SVM.
4. Introduce a simple non-topological baseline to quantify true added value; if baseline PR AUC close to 0.75+, current stack’s gain may not justify complexity.
5. Examine class imbalance handling: try precision-oriented objective or focal loss variant via a probabilistic model.
6. Inspect top contributing GBT features (many zeros; concentration in a few dimensions suggests pruning + dimensionality reduction could help).

Quick incremental (low-risk) next steps if you still want a fast pass:
- Implement near-zero variance threshold (e.g., 1e-6) and re-run to see if training time drops without PR AUC loss.
- Standardize / scale blocks separately (if not already) and re-check ROC AUC shift.
- Add calibrated probabilities for SVM & LR (cross-validated) to see if threshold stability improves.

If those do not lift ROC AUC meaningfully (>0.05), pivot to revisiting the TDA representation pipeline rather than solver tuning. Let me know which branch you want to pursue and I can script it.

_**User**_

The passes are not particularly fast but I think we should have one more low-risk pass using your quick incremental suggestions and then we will reassess. It feels like solver tuning probably isn't going to help. However, one other question is perhaps we need to examine another dataset but we will save that for another run.

In addition to your quick steps I think we need to check for temporal and data leakage, something doesn't feel quite right there

Implementing the low‑risk pass: added near‑zero variance pruning default (1e-6), optional post-standardization, and comprehensive leakage diagnostics (duplicate basenames, exact signature overlap, temporal gap, quartile drift, rank-based time/label correlation). Code passes analysis (no issues).

Checklist:
- Near-zero variance threshold added (default 1e-6) Done
- Optional global StandardScaler flag (--post-standardize) Done
- Leakage diagnostics (duplicates, signature overlap, temporal ordering, attack rate drift, correlation) Done
- Persist leakage info into diagnostics.json Done
- Static analysis scan after edit Done (clean)

Next recommended run (fast, minimal ablations):
1. Activate env and run with pruning + post-standardization + skip ablations, disable calibration for speed:
   python -m validation.extract_vector_stack --prune-zero-variance --post-standardize --skip-ablations --no-calibration --sw-angles 32 --lr-max-iter 4000 --svm-max-iter 4000
2. Inspect results/diagnostics.json for:
   - leakage_checks.potential_leakage_flag
   - attack_rate_time_quartiles drift
   - improved training times / dims after pruning
3. If leakage flag triggers, halt further tuning and investigate manifest construction.

Interpretation expectations:
- If ROC AUC lifts meaningfully (>0.03) after scaling/pruning, proceed with selective calibration (LR only).
- If leakage flag true (especially exact_signature_overlap_count > 0), we must rebuild temporal split.

Tell me if you'd like me to execute the run now or adjust parameters (e.g., different variance threshold).
