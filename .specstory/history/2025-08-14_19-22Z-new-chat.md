I'll search the workspace for the failing test name to locate the test definition and relevant code, then run the specific test to capture the full error output for diagnosis.

I'll open the test source to see what StreamingVRParity does and then run the specific test binary to capture the full error output for diagnosis. I'll search for the StreamingVRComplex implementation and its statistics structure to see how threshold is set and propagated.

I'll open the streaming VR headers and implementation to see how epsilon/threshold is handled and why stats.threshold isn't set to eps.

I'll patch the streaming VR and ÄŒech implementations to persist the effective threshold back into the config so getStatistics reports the correct value, then rerun the failing test to verify it passes.
