I can see you have a comprehensive TDA (Topological Data Analysis) project with both C++ and Python components. To continue effectively, I need to understand what specific work you'd like me to help with.

Let me first explore the current state of your project to get oriented:

I can see you have a well-structured TDA platform with C++23 components, test files, and a build system. Let me check if there are any existing tasks or if we need to initialize Taskmaster:

Excellent! I can see you have a comprehensive TDA platform project with well-structured tasks. Looking at the current status, you have:

- **Task 1 (Core Persistent Homology)**: Mostly complete with some pending subtasks
- **Task 11 (C++23 Environment)**: Complete
- **Tasks 2-10**: Various stages of completion

Let me check what the next priority task should be:

I see the issue - there are some pending subtasks in Task 1 that need to be completed before moving forward. Let me examine the specific pending subtasks:

Now I understand the current state! You have several pending subtasks in Task 1 that need to be completed. Based on the dependencies, the logical next steps are:

1. **Subtask 1.5**: Implement Persistence Diagram and Barcode Data Structure Generation
2. **Subtask 1.7**: Optimize Engine for Large-Scale Point Clouds
3. **Subtask 1.8**: Develop C++ API and Python Bindings

Let me check the current codebase to see what's already implemented and what needs to be done:
