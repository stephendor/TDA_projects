_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create a plan for tackling task 2 in the taskmaster MCP. First, I need to activate the sequential thinking and code analysis tools, then explore what tasks are available in your taskmaster MCP system. Let me try using the sequential thinking tool directly: Now I'll check the project structure to better understand the context and look for taskmaster-related files or configurations. Let me look for the .taskmaster directory: Now let's check the .taskmaster directory structure: Let's check the tasks directory: Now let's read task_002.txt to understand what we need to plan for: Let's also read the tasks.json file to get a full overview of the tasks: Let's continue reading the task 2 details from tasks.json: Let's continue reading `tasks.json` to find the details of task 2: Let me continue reading task 2: Let's look for the implementation of the vectorization algorithms to understand what's already been done: Let's search for persistence images as well: Let's now search for database schema implementations: Let's check for implemented files related to vectorization and database schemas: Let's check for more general vectorization or database related files: Let's look at the source code directories more comprehensively: Now let's look at the vector_stack directory since that's likely where the vectorization methods would be implemented: Let's also check the Python implementation: Now, let's look at the backend directory to find database-related implementations: Let's check the services directory for database services: Let's check the tda_backend directory: Let's check the services here: Let's check the storage_service.py file which might contain the database implementations: Let's continue reading the `storage_service.py` file: Let's continue reading the `storage_service.py` file: Let's continue reading the `storage_service.py` file to find any mentions of the database implementation: Let's continue reading and look for the final part of the file: Let's check the tda_service.py file as well to see if there's any vectorization-related code: Let's examine the C++ files in the vector_stack directory to understand what's already implemented: Let's look at the vector_operations.cpp file: Now let's check the vector_stack.cpp file: Let's check the include directory for the vector_stack.hpp header: Let's check the vector_stack.hpp file to understand the implemented functionalities: Let's now use the Zen planner to create a comprehensive plan for implementing Task 2: Let me correct that and try again: Let me take some time to think deeply about this planning challenge before proceeding to step 2. Now that I've done the deep thinking, let's continue with step 2 of the planner: Let me continue with the required deep thinking before moving to step 3: [object Object]

Now, let me continue with the Zen planner for the next step: Let me pause for the required strategic reflection before proceeding to step 4: Now I'll continue with step 4 of the Zen planner: Let's complete the plan with the final step: # Comprehensive Implementation Plan for Task 2: Develop Basic Topological Feature Vectorization and Storage

## 4. Technical Specifications

### C++ Vectorization Interface
```cpp
// Base class for all vectorization methods
class Vectorization {
public:
    // Convert a persistence diagram to a vector representation
    virtual std::vector<double> vectorize(const PersistenceDiagram& diagram) const = 0;
    
    // Get the name of the vectorization method
    virtual std::string getName() const = 0;
    
    // Get the parameters of the vectorization method
    virtual VectorizationParams getParameters() const = 0;
    
    // Calculate distance between two vectorizations
    virtual double distance(const std::vector<double>& vec1, 
                           const std::vector<double>& vec2) const = 0;
};
```

### Database Schema

**PostgreSQL Tables:**
- `persistence_diagrams`: Stores metadata about diagrams
- `vectorizations`: Records information about vectorization results
- `version_history`: Tracks changes to entities over time

**MongoDB Collections:**
- `persistence_diagrams`: Stores actual diagram points and data
- `vectorizations`: Contains vectorized features in optimized format

### Python API Design
```python
# High-level Python API for vectorization
class TDAVectorization:
    @staticmethod
    def create_betti_curve(resolution=100, smooth=False):
        """Create a Betti curve vectorization object"""
        pass
    
    @staticmethod
    def vectorize_diagram(diagram, method, **parameters):
        """Vectorize a persistence diagram using the specified method"""
        pass
    
    @staticmethod
    def save_vectorization(diagram_id, method, vector, parameters):
        """Save a vectorization to storage"""
        pass
```

### Key Performance Indicators
- Unit test coverage (target: >90%)
- Algorithm performance (target: <100ms for typical diagrams)
- API usability (validated through example usage)
- Database query performance (target: <50ms for typical queries)

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- Mathematical complexity: Start with prototypes, validate against published results
