# Setup background agents for TDA projects (2025-08-12 19:24Z)

_**User**_

I need to set up the following background agents to work on tasks found in my .taskmaster folder in the TDA_projects repo. Like this:

�� BACKGROUND AGENT TASKS
Agent 1: "Research & Planning Agent"
Tasks: 2, 5 (High-level research and architecture)
Task 2: Develop Basic Topological Feature Vectorization and Storage
Task 5: Implement Advanced Learnable Topological Features
Why: These are research-heavy, require literature review, and can be planned in parallel while you build the core engine.
Agent 2: "Infrastructure Planning Agent"
Tasks: 6, 7 (Domain-specific research and planning)
Task 6: Build Finance Module for Market Regime Detection
Task 7: Build Cybersecurity Module for Anomaly Detection
Why: These require domain expertise research, dataset analysis, and can be planned while core algorithms are being built.
Agent 3: "Performance & Scaling Agent"
Tasks: 8, 9, 10 (Optimization and infrastructure)
Task 8: Optimize for Performance and Scalability
Task 9: Implement Security, Authentication, and Auditing
Task 10: Finalize UI/UX and Implement Mapper Algorithm
Why: These are infrastructure-heavy and can be researched/planned while core development is happening.
🚫 NOT SUITABLE FOR BACKGROUND AGENTS
Task 3: Backend API (depends on Task 1 completion)
Task 4: UI Development (depends on Task 3)
Task 1.x: Core algorithms (your main focus

I'm going to scan your workspace to locate the `TDA_projects` repository and inspect the `.taskmaster` folder and task definitions so I can configure the background agents and their assignments.

I'm going to open the `.taskmaster` directory to find task files and configuration, then read any task definitions to map the requested agent assignments.

Scanning the project root and the `.taskmaster` directory to locate task files and configuration so I can map tasks to the requested background agents.

Reviewing `.taskmaster` configuration and tasks to set up agents and map the requested task IDs. I'll open the config, state, and list the task files, then peek into scripts to see how to register background agents.

I'm going to search the `.taskmaster` directory for any references to "agent", "background", or "runner" to understand how agents are expected to be defined or executed, and then open the relevant task files (2,5,6,7,8,9,10) to confirm their content and IDs.

---



---



---

I’m going to open the task definitions (JSON and specific task files 2,5,6,7,8,9,10) and list the docs folder to understand how to integrate agents. Then I’ll create a lightweight background runner script per agent to watch and generate reports for the assigned tasks.

Creating agent config and a Python background runner that reads `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json`, maps tasks to agents per your plan, generates planning documents under `.taskmaster/reports/agents/...`, and keeps watching for changes. Then I'll start it in the background.

<details><summary>Edit file: .taskmaster/agents/agents.json</summary>

I will add the background agents configuration mapping agents to task IDs and include rationale text for each agent.

- Set up three background agents and assignments in `.taskmaster/agents/agents.json`:
  - Research & Planning Agent: tasks 2, 5
  - Infrastructure Planning Agent: tasks 6, 7
  - Performance & Scaling Agent: tasks 8, 9, 10
- Added watcher script at `.taskmaster/scripts/agent_runner.py` that reads tasks and generates/refreshes planning docs.
- Started the watcher in the background; plans were generated under `.taskmaster/reports/agents/...` (e.g., `agent_research_planning_research--planning-agent/task_002_develop-basic-topological-feature-vectorization-and-storage/plan.md`).

Run/adjust:
- Start/refresh manually: `python3 .taskmaster/scripts/agent_runner.py --watch --interval 15`
- One-off generation: `python3 .taskmaster/scripts/agent_runner.py`
- Edit assignments: update `assignedTaskIds` in `.taskmaster/agents/agents.json`.

- Created `.taskmaster/agents/README.md` with usage.

- Verified outputs exist for tasks 2,5,6,7,8,9,10 with tailored planning content and dependencies.

- If you want these agents to do more than planning (e.g., auto-research hooks or integration tickets), say the word and I’ll extend the runner.

- Changes and impact:
  - Added `agents.json` with your requested agent-task mapping.
  - Added a Python background runner and launched it; it keeps plans up to date on file changes.
  - Generated initial plans in `.taskmaster/reports/agents/` for all assigned tasks.
