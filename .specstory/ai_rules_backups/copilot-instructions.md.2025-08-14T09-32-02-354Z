**Remember**: This is a **comprehensive enterprise TDA platform**, not a simple research project. Maintain the full scope and architecture while implementing with modern C++23 best practices. **NEVER** assume the scope has been simplified without explicit evidence.

## ⚙️ **WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES**

### General Workflow
- **ALWAYS** activate the virtual environment (`source .venv/bin/activate`) before running any Python scripts or commands.
- **YOU** (the AI) must run all commands, monitor terminal outputs, and handle errors immediately.
- **I** (the user) do not need to be copying or pasting anything at any point, unless explicitly requested.
- **YOU** are forbidden from presenting code in any way other than executable code blocks with Run/Cancel buttons.
- **ALWAYS** perform static analysis (Codacy) after modifying any code.
- When addressing memory blowup issues (reference `docs/troubleshooting/memory_blowup_RCA_steps.md`), prioritize steady but significant improvements, maintaining control for easy reversion and repair. Ensure alignment with Taskmaster planning and Agent Instruction files. Employ a rigorous, scalable approach with extensive testing.
- **Workflow for Executing Plans**: Locate relevant plans (e.g., RCA-related docs and strategy plans), extract actionable steps, and execute them. Begin with builds/tests and documentation updates. Open troubleshooting plans to extract checklists and execute concrete steps (build/validate, monitoring hooks, etc.).
- **Execution Steps for RCA and Strategy Plans**: Read `CMakeLists.txt` and tests CMake to understand how tests are built and where to add new targets, plus verify any sanitizer/-fPIC issues mentioned in the plan. Open the ST-101 memory-optimized test and related tests to see what’s already implemented and identify missing pieces (like MemoryMonitor or StreamingDistanceMatrix) we need to add next. Search the codebase for the MemoryMonitor and StreamingDistanceMatrix classes referenced in the plans/tests to see if they exist, and identify missing files we need to implement.
- **Plan References**: When addressing memory blowup issues, the primary reference documents are `memory_blowup_RCA_steps.md` and `RCA_Plan.md`.
- **Coding and Testing**: When implementing new components like `StreamingDistanceMatrix`, create a reusable component (header + source), wire it into the build, and add a unit test to validate correctness and memory-bounded behavior.

### Experimentation
- For controlled experiments, ensure a deterministic setup: same seed, identical non-filtration flags.
- If point cloud coverage is low (<80%), abort the variant run.
- If Gudhi import fails, classify the variant as SKIPPED.
- Monitor H1 interval counts for over-pruning.
- Verify manifest hash changes appropriately, incorporating filtration mode and parameters.
- If filtration recompute is inactive, generate a warning and optionally fail-fast.

### Success Criteria

- Keep only variants meeting PASS or (for sparse) efficiency PASS criteria.
- Document negative results rigorously—failure is acceptable, unrecorded effort is not.

## 🛠️ **DEBUGGING**

- If a required diagnostics key is missing, patch the code to include it before running any variant runs.
- If any variant run crashes, analyze the terminal output, fix the issue, and rerun the variant.
- If the manifest hash does not change as expected for a variant, investigate the hashing logic and correct it.
- If filtration recompute is not active (attempted_count is 0), ensure that point clouds are generated and accessible in the expected location.
- If the process appears to stall, particularly with large datasets, inspect the performance harness source and target wiring to understand the exact parameters, modes, and potential blocking points. Run small DM-only probes and constrained runs with time/memory stats to diagnose the issue.

## 🧪 **VALIDATION & TESTING**

- If leakage is detected (potential_leakage_flag is true), stop all further tuning and investigate manifest construction.
- Before accepting a new configuration, always validate full vs pruned pipeline once.
- Update testing to include a lean run for sanity checking, then a full run. Determine if settings need tuning. Find a lean lower bound and then step up in stages to a full run.
- **ALWAYS** run a lean 200K sanity probe (e.g., maxDim=1, K=8–16, tighter radius or time/pair caps), then step up to fuller config and compare adjacency histograms and peak RSS at each step.
- Validate that DM knn_cap_per_vertex_soft reduces work without unacceptable loss; compare simplex counts and adjacency degree distributions across runs.

## 🗑️ **METHODOLOGY GRAVEYARD**
- Document all failed approaches and their rationale in `METHODOLOGY_GRAVEYARD.md`.

## 📈 **PERFORMANCE TUNING**

- After representation gains, calibrate the best-performing model only.
- Consider Elastic Net LR (l1_ratio ~0.2–0.4) for structured sparsity.

## 📊 **REPORTING**

- Record results in `daily_logs/20250810_filtration_experiment_plan.md`.

## 💾 **VERSION UPDATES**
- Ensure changes to parameters and settings are reflected in manifest hashes.

## 📚 **PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM**
- UNIFIED_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md contains high-level instructions for the AI coding assistant.
- `RCA_Plan.md` contains plans for addressing memory blowup issues.
- `memory_blowup_RCA_steps.md` contains steps for addressing memory blowup issues.
- `docs/performance/README.md`: Contains information on baseline comparisons without memory overlap, including the use of flags such as `--baseline-separate-process` and `--baseline-json-out`.
  - Added a “Baseline comparisons without memory overlap” section with flags and an example.
  - Appended the separate-process baseline JSONL note.
  - Updated docs to note the new JSON fields (dm_peakMB, rss_peakMB, softcap_overshoot_*, parallel_threshold).
  - Corrected harness path to `test_streaming_cech_perf`.
  - Documented new telemetry fields: dm_peakMB, rss_peakMB, softcap_overshoot_sum, softcap_overshoot_max, parallel_threshold (kept legacy underscore keys noted).
  - Clarified baseline compare usage (separate process) and accuracy script examples.
  - Added “Accuracy reports and thresholds” section with example invocation.
  - Added “Reference artifacts (2025-08-14, 1M Čech…)”
- `docs/troubleshooting/RCA_Progress_Check`:
  - (Add a short note with the 1M metrics and deltas after the final run)
  - Added 1M checkpoint summary

## 🧠 **MEMORY MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES**

  --name tda-staging \
  --memory="16g" \
  --cpus="4" \
  -v $(pwd):/workspace \
  ubuntu:22.04

# This simulates production constraints
````

## 🗺️ **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

### Phase 1 — CI gating and profiler wiring (fast wins)

- Add profiler harness and scripts (referenced in RCA_Plan.md)
  - Tasks:
    - Add `scripts/run_performance_validation.sh` to orchestrate small/medium probes with flags (serial threshold, soft-cap).
    - Add `scripts/analyze_performance_logs.py` to parse JSONL/CSV (dm_edges, simplices, overshoot, peakMB, adjacency histograms).
    - Document usage in `README.md`.
  - DoD:
    - Running the script produces a summary of overshoot=0 (serial), adjacency degree stats, peakMB, plus a pass/fail footer.

- CI parsing and gating of uploaded artifacts (RCA_Plan.md; memory_blowup_RCA_steps.md)
  - Tasks:
    - Add a CI step to parse JSONL/CSV artifacts from `/tmp/tda-artifacts`.
    - Gate on:
      - serial threshold → overshoot_sum == 0 and overshoot_max == 0.
      - dm_peakMB and rss_peakMB presence with numeric values.
      - adj histogram CSVs exist and non-empty; compute mean/median degree.
    - Persist a baseline artifact and compare new run against last-accepted baseline within tolerance (e.g., ±10% dm_edges/simplices for identical params).
  - DoD:
    - CI fails if overshoot > 0 in serial mode or artifacts are missing/corrupt; logs show parsed metrics and tolerances.

### Phase 2 — Scale-up staircase runs and reporting

- Staircase probes: 200K → 500K → 1M (memory_blowup_RCA_steps.md)
  - Tasks:
    - Add jobs or parametrized script invocations for 200K/500K/1M DM-only and Čech (maxDim=1 for time bounds).
    - Capture time/memory stats; export JSONL + adj hist CSV per run.
    - Write results to `daily_logs/YYYYMMDD_*` (as per project logging practice).
  - DoD:
    - Each size produces artifacts and a summarized log including dm_blocks, dm_edges, simplices, overshoot, peakMB, wall-clock.
    - CI stores them as artifacts; logs include a short comparison table vs. previous acceptable baseline.

- Accuracy footprint with soft-cap vs exact small-n (RCA_Plan.md)
  - Tasks:
    - Define small-n exact runs (e.g., n=2K–4K) using dense baseline and serial threshold.
    - Run soft-cap variants (K=8/16/32) and measure deltas in:
      - edge counts, adjacency degree distributions,
      - H1 interval counts (requires computing persistence diagrams).
    - Emit a compact “accuracy report” JSON (delta_% per metric).
  - DoD:
    - Report JSON attached to CI artifacts; CI warns (but does not fail) if deltas exceed configurable thresholds; documentation updated with guidance.

### Phase 3 — Streaming VR variant with memory backpressure

- Implement block-based VR generation (RCA_Plan.md Phase 2)
  - Tasks:
    - Add a streaming VR builder mirroring Čech’s block/tiling approach with bounded-degree adjacency and memory backpressure.
    - Telemetry parity with Čech: simplex counts by dim, adj histogram, peak memory.
    - CLI flags in the harness to select VR mode; export same JSONL/CSV.
  - DoD:
    - Unit tests on small-n exact parity; perf probe runs produce VR artifacts; CI job exercises VR path and uploads outputs.

### Phase 4 — SimplexPool fragmentation telemetry and maintenance

- Fragmentation metrics and defragmentation hooks (RCA_Plan.md)
  - Tasks:
    - Extend `SimplexPool` to track:
      - allocated pages, free-list size, fragmentation ratio.
    - Add optional defragmentation routine (manual/periodic).
    - Telemetry integration into JSONL (pool_*) fields.
  - DoD:
    - Unit tests assert stable metrics under churn scenarios; JSONL shows pool telemetry; docs updated with “when to defragment”.

### Phase 5 — Stalling diagnostics and reliability guards

- Stalling/timeouts with parameter echo (memory_blowup_RCA_steps.md)
  - Tasks:
    - Add harness timeout guard for probes; on timeout, print current params, block indices, and partial telemetry.
    - Add DM-only quick probe in CI with tight timeout; fail-fast with actionable log.
  - DoD:
    - CI shows clear “timeout diagnostics” section when exceeded; partial artifacts still uploaded.

- Manifest hashing and recompute safeguards (memory_blowup_RCA_steps.md)
  - Tasks:
    - Ensure manifest hash includes filtration mode and all params (e.g., radius, K, caps, parallel-threshold, maxDim).
    - Warn/fail if recompute inactive (attempted_count == 0) given a new hash.
    - Add unit tests for hashing determinism and param coverage.
  - DoD:
    - Tests green; CI logs include manifest hash; missing recompute triggers warning/failure per configuration.

### Phase 6 — Optional accelerators and distribution (roadmap alignment)

- GPU acceleration for distance blocks (RCA_Plan.md Phase 3/5)
  - Tasks:
    - Optional CUDA path for blockwise distance; env/flag to enable.
    - Validate correctness on small-n and measure throughput gains.
  - DoD:
    - Feature flag documented; small benchmark shows meaningful speedup; CPU fallback remains default.

- Distributed hooks (Flink/Spark) for batched adjacency (RCA_Plan.md Phase 5)
  - Tasks:
    - Define an export format for block tasks and edge emissions.
    - Provide a minimal adapter or doc example to map blocks into stream processing.
  - DoD:
    - Reference pipeline documented; not gated in CI.

### Cross-cutting acceptance criteria

- Telemetry
  - All runs export JSONL with dm_blocks, dm_edges, simplices, dm_peakMB/rss_peakMB, overshoot_sum/max; adjacency CSVs present when requested.

- Determinism and policy
  - When soft-cap active and accuracy mode selected: `parallel-threshold=0`; overshoot must be 0.

- CI reliability
  - Artifact uploads are stable; parser reports a succinct summary and enforces critical gates.

## COMMIT MESSAGE GUIDELINES

- Ensure commit messages are concise and clearly describe the changes made.
- Include relevant references to plans (e.g., `docs/troubleshooting/RCA_Plan.md`, `memory_blowup_RCA_steps.md`).
- Follow a consistent format (e.g., `feat(utils): add MemoryMonitor telemetry to StreamingDistanceMatrix`).

    - **ALWAYS** add a CI workflow step that runs the analyzer on artifacts placed in `docs/performance/artifacts/2025-08-14_1m_cech` and prints a compact summary in PR checks (gate must be ON with require-csv).
    - **ALWAYS** upload artifacts to PR.
    - **ALWAYS** add a template job to run a 200k DM-only probe on PRs (tight timeout) to catch regressions early, uploading artifacts for inspection.
