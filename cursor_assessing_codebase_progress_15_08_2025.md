bugbot use the attached files and task files in .taskmaster/ to assess the progress on improving our codebase. We need to reassess our position with respect to Task 1 and consider bugs, missing elements, poorly designed elements and any other issues from the PRP. memory_blowup_RCA_steps was the bug report that preceded this one and there was another before that to consider. 

Examine elements in the codebase related to task 2 and assess our position with respect to our goals in the PRP. What needs to be done to integrate these elements with the broader project

I’m going to pull the current Taskmaster tasks (including subtasks) and available tags to assess Task 1 and Task 2, scan the troubleshooting docs for prior bug reports, and read the troubleshooting README for PRP context.

I’m going to quickly verify whether the tests and harness mentioned in the troubleshooting docs actually exist (e.g., StreamingVRParity, VRTelemetryPresence), and scan for Task 2 code integration points (vectorization service, DB schemas) to assess integration gaps.

I’m going to search the codebase for actual Task 2 implementations (landscapes, images, Betti curves) and their integration points (C++ library, Python bindings, DB schemas), plus confirm presence of PRP or requirements references.

I’m going to scan the codebase for Task 2 implementation artifacts: vectorization classes in C++ (e.g., PersistenceLandscape/Image, VectorStack), Python bindings/services that expose vectorization, and database integration (PostgreSQL via SQLAlchemy/psycopg2 and MongoDB via pymongo/motor). I'll run parallel searches to keep this quick.

Let me help, I've altered the document that indicated remaining. You will find test data related to the memory blowup in performance/ as well as additions to test/ and src/  There are .csv and .jsonl in root that contain data as well.

---

**Cursor**

I’m going to locate the new artifacts and code changes you mentioned and verify key implementation pieces:
- Find performance artifacts (.csv/.jsonl) and the performance directory
- Confirm test and src additions for memory blowup probes
- Check SimplexPool fragmentation/defragmentation telemetry
- Verify Task 2 vectorization implementations and DB integration hooks (Postgres/Mongo)
- Confirm scripts for analyzer gating exist and are wired

I’m going to quickly search for concrete Task 2 implementations and storage layers: persistence vectorizers in C++/Python, and actual ORM models/DAOs for Postgres and collections for Mongo.

Status: I located the new artifacts and code you mentioned:
- Performance artifacts: `docs/performance/artifacts/2025-08-14_1m_cech/*` and `docs/performance/artifacts/2025-08-15_vr_ladder/*`. Root-level artifacts also exist: `_baseline.jsonl`, `_adj_base.csv`, `_adj_cur.csv`, `.jsonl`.
- Tests and src additions: `tests/cpp/test_st101_memory_optimized.cpp` and `tests/cpp/CMakeLists.txt` register `ST101MemoryOptimized`, `StreamingVRParity`, `VRTelemetryPresence`, `VRAdjHistPresence`. Core streaming implementations and telemetry are present in `src/cpp/algorithms/streaming_cech.cpp` and `streaming_vr.cpp` with `SimplexPool::defragment()` hooks. Analyzer scripts exist and are referenced: `scripts/run_performance_validation.sh`, `scripts/analyze_performance_logs.py`.
- Backend Task 2 integration: no ORM models or migrations yet (only `sqlalchemy`, `asyncpg`, `alembic` in `backend/pyproject.toml` and a TODO); no Mongo/Motor dependency or usage; streaming jobs contain placeholder persistence calculations; no vectorizer bindings or API endpoints found.

### Task 1 — Core TDA status vs PRP (ST-101)
- Done
  - Streaming Čech/VR with memory backpressure and telemetry: `src/cpp/algorithms/streaming_cech.cpp`, `streaming_vr.cpp`.
  - Pool fragmentation telemetry and optional defrag: `SimplexPool::defragment()` invoked when `fragmentation>=0.95` and pool is sizable.
  - CI-oriented probes and tests: ST-101 test and VR parity/telemetry/CSV presence registered in `tests/cpp/CMakeLists.txt`.
  - Analyzer and gating scripts present; artifacts show final 1M Čech parent vs separate-process baseline with overshoot=0 and PASS: `docs/performance/artifacts/2025-08-14_1m_cech/*`.
  - Build hygiene for sanitizers (`-fPIC`) fixed in `CMakeLists.txt`.
- Gaps / risks
  - Backend streaming jobs use placeholder persistence logic (`backend/flink/jobs/tda-streaming-job.py`), not the C++ engine or the harness; this diverges from PRP accuracy/perf guarantees.
  - GPU path is stubbed (partial) and feature-flagged; OK as optional but not yet contributing to SLO headroom.
  - Ensure CI actually runs `scripts/analyze_performance_logs.py --gate --require-csv` on uploaded artifacts; docs indicate it, but verify workflow wiring.

### Task 2 — Vectorization & Storage status vs PRP (FR-CORE-002, ST-301)
- Present
  - Core diagram/barcode/betti structures (`include/src/cpp/vector_stack/*`) and pybind module scaffold (`src/python/vector_stack_bindings.cpp`).
  - Docs and training guides outline vectorization blocks (landscapes/images), determinism, and config hashing.
- Missing/poorly integrated
  - No implemented vectorizers for Persistence Landscapes or Persistence Images in `src/cpp` (only conceptual references in docs).
  - No pybind11 bindings exposing vectorization functions.
  - No API endpoints/services to request vectorization.
  - No persistence layer:
    - Postgres: no SQLAlchemy models/migrations for metadata/versioning (only config and TODO).
    - MongoDB: no Motor/PyMongo dependency or collections for diagrams/features.
  - No Kafka/Flink schema/messages for vectorized outputs; current schemas cover job/result/file/error only.
  - No tests asserting vectorizer correctness (shape, stability, determinism) against small-n baselines (e.g., giotto-tda parity).

### Bugs, missing elements, design issues (from PRP perspective)
- Backend placeholder persistence in Flink jobs will yield incorrect/unstable results; must be replaced with calls to the core engine or API.
- Task 2 deliverables (vectorizers + storage + API) largely absent; marked “done” in tasks but not present in code paths used by API/streaming.
- Root-level `.jsonl/.csv` artifacts are unmanaged; prefer moving to `docs/performance/artifacts/` and teaching the analyzer to ignore stray root files to avoid CI noise.

### What to do next to integrate Task 2 with the broader project
1. Implement vectorizers (C++23)
   - Add `PersistenceLandscapeBlock`, `PersistenceImageBlock` and a `VectorizationStack` orchestrator with deterministic config and global range handling.
   - SIMD where appropriate; SoA layout; ensure numerical determinism and stable seeding.
2. Bindings and API
   - Expose vectorizers via pybind11 (`src/python/tda_module.cpp`) with typed configs (k_max, grid, sigma, range policy).
   - Add FastAPI endpoints:
     - `POST /v1/vectorize` (sync small jobs) and an async job path to pipeline vectorization post-homology.
3. Storage layers (ST-301)
   - Postgres (SQLAlchemy + Alembic): models for `jobs`, `artifacts`, `vector_features` with versioned config/hash, indexes for retrieval.
   - Mongo (Motor): collections for raw diagrams and large vectors; consider compressed arrays or GridFS for images.
   - Create initial migrations; wire `DATABASE_URL` and health checks.
4. Messaging/streaming integration
   - Extend Kafka schemas with `tda-vectorized-features` subject; include config manifest hash and provenance (job_id, diagram_id).
   - Flink jobs: consume result messages, call API/core for vectorization, emit vectorized feature messages; add metrics and error paths.
5. CI and tests
   - Unit tests for landscapes/images (shapes, invariance, stability); parity checks against giotto-tda for small-n.
   - Performance tests for vectorizer throughput; include in `run_performance_validation.sh`.
   - Update CI to parse and gate vectorizer metrics (e.g., config determinism, output presence).
6. Artifacts hygiene
   - Move root `_adj_*.csv`, `*.jsonl` into `docs/performance/artifacts/<date_tag>/`.
   - Ensure analyzer targets `TDA_ARTIFACT_DIR` exclusively to avoid stray files.

### Use of the new test data you added
- The ladder and final-run artifacts are where the analyzer expects them; root files should be relocated or ignored by analyzer config.
- The added `tests/` and `src/` entries around pool telemetry and streaming VR/Čech are aligned with the RCA plan and are being exercised by the registered tests.

- Configure vectorization+storage integration as above, then we can add a staircase run that includes vectorizer timing/memory and a small-n accuracy footprint report.

- If you want, I can add a focused set of tasks for Task 2 integration (models/migrations, vectorizer C++ implementation, bindings, API endpoints, Flink wiring, tests) and wire the analyzer to gate on vectorizer outputs.

- Key impacts
  - Task 1: ST-101 looks green with telemetry and CI gates; replace placeholders in streaming backend to align runtime with the core.
  - Task 2: Core functionality is not integrated yet; implement vectorizers, bind to API, and persist outputs to meet PRP requirements.
