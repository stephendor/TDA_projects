# Task 7: Build Cybersecurity Module for Anomaly Detection

Agent: Infrastructure Planning Agent (agent_infra_planning)
Why: These require domain expertise research, dataset analysis, and can be planned while core algorithms are being built.

## Summary
Implement features for real-time network traffic analysis and threat detection as per FR-CYB-001, FR-CYB-002, and ST-103.

## Focus & Key Decisions
Focus: stream ingestion, windowing, topological signatures, baseline modeling, anomaly thresholds, attack classification.
Key decisions: Kafka/Flink integration contracts, feature latency budget, labeling strategy, evaluation metrics.

## Dependencies
- 3: Build Backend API and Initial Streaming Infrastructure
- 5: Implement Advanced Learnable Topological Features

## Deliverables
- Architecture overview and data flow
- Detailed spec and acceptance tests derived from 'Test Strategy'
- Milestone plan with risks and mitigations
- Open questions and research notes

## Details
Utilize the streaming architecture (Task 3) to process network packet streams in real-time. Implement sliding window analysis to extract topological features from traffic data. Develop models to detect deviations from baseline topological signatures and classify common attack patterns (DDoS, SQL injection).

## Test Strategy
Test the module with captured network traffic datasets (e.g., CIC-IDS2017). Conduct red team exercises to validate detection capabilities against live attacks. Measure and optimize for a false positive rate below 50% and classification accuracy above 75%.

## Milestones
1. Requirements refinement and literature scan
2. Prototype design and validation criteria
3. Implementation plan (phased)
4. Benchmarks and evaluation
5. Handover/Integration steps

## Open Questions
- [ ] TBD
