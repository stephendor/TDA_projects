# Task 6: Build Finance Module for Market Regime Detection

Agent: Infrastructure Planning Agent (agent_infra_planning)
Why: These require domain expertise research, dataset analysis, and can be planned while core algorithms are being built.

## Summary
Implement the features required for financial market regime detection as specified in FR-FIN-001 and ST-102.

## Focus & Key Decisions
Focus: data connectors (equities/crypto), sliding-window embeddings, unsupervised transition detection, stability metric, EWS.
Key decisions: window sizes, normalization, distance metrics on PDs/landscapes, thresholding logic, backtesting protocol.

## Dependencies
- 5: Implement Advanced Learnable Topological Features

## Deliverables
- Architecture overview and data flow
- Detailed spec and acceptance tests derived from 'Test Strategy'
- Milestone plan with risks and mitigations
- Open questions and research notes

## Details
Create a dedicated module that uses topological features (from tasks 1, 2, 5) to analyze financial time-series data. Develop models to identify topological transitions in market structure, quantify regime stability, and generate configurable early warning signals for multiple asset classes.

## Test Strategy
Backtest the module on historical financial data (equities, crypto) to validate accuracy (>85%) and latency (<100ms). Compare the model's detections against known historical market events and established financial indicators.

## Milestones
1. Requirements refinement and literature scan
2. Prototype design and validation criteria
3. Implementation plan (phased)
4. Benchmarks and evaluation
5. Handover/Integration steps

## Open Questions
- [ ] TBD
