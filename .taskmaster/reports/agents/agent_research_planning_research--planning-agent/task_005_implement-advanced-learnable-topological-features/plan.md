# Task 5: Implement Advanced Learnable Topological Features

Agent: Research & Planning Agent (agent_research_planning)
Why: These are research-heavy, require literature review, and can be planned in parallel while the core engine is built.

## Summary
Develop and integrate learnable topological feature extraction methods to be used in deep learning models, as per FR-CORE-002.

## Focus & Key Decisions
Focus: PyTorch layers over PDs (attention, hierarchical, TDA-GNN); autograd compatibility; batching; numerical stability.
Key decisions: differentiable diagram encodings, memory layout, PyTorch Geometric integration, benchmarking datasets.

## Dependencies
- 2: Develop Basic Topological Feature Vectorization and Storage

## Deliverables
- Architecture overview and data flow
- Detailed spec and acceptance tests derived from 'Test Strategy'
- Milestone plan with risks and mitigations
- Open questions and research notes

## Details
Implement novel TDA layers in PyTorch, including persistence attention mechanisms, hierarchical clustering features, and TDA-GNN embeddings. These layers should be designed to integrate seamlessly into existing deep learning architectures.

## Test Strategy
Unit test each new layer for mathematical correctness, output shape, and proper gradient flow. Integrate the layers into a sample model and verify performance improvement over baseline methods on a benchmark classification or regression task.

## Milestones
1. Requirements refinement and literature scan
2. Prototype design and validation criteria
3. Implementation plan (phased)
4. Benchmarks and evaluation
5. Handover/Integration steps

## Open Questions
- [ ] TBD
