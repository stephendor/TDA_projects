# Task 2: Develop Basic Topological Feature Vectorization and Storage

Agent: Research & Planning Agent (agent_research_planning)
Why: These are research-heavy, require literature review, and can be planned in parallel while the core engine is built.

## Summary
Create deterministic vectorization methods and establish a database schema for storing and retrieving topological features.

## Focus & Key Decisions
Focus: deterministic vectorization (landscapes, images, Betti curves); schema design in PostgreSQL/MongoDB; indexing & versioning; similarity search primitives.
Key decisions: feature parametrization grids, normalization, diagram persistence format, DB indices (GIN/GiST), cosine vs. Wasserstein proxy.

## Dependencies
- 1: Implement Core Persistent Homology Algorithms

## Deliverables
- Architecture overview and data flow
- Detailed spec and acceptance tests derived from 'Test Strategy'
- Milestone plan with risks and mitigations
- Open questions and research notes

## Details
Implement the deterministic vector-stack method including persistence landscapes, images, and Betti curves (FR-CORE-002). Design and implement a database schema using PostgreSQL and MongoDB for storing persistence diagrams, barcodes, and vectorized features. The schema must support efficient indexing and versioning as per ST-301.

## Test Strategy
Verify that vectorization outputs are correct and consistent for given inputs. Test database performance for write throughput and query latency on stored topological features. Ensure the schema correctly supports versioning and similarity searches.

## Milestones
1. Requirements refinement and literature scan
2. Prototype design and validation criteria
3. Implementation plan (phased)
4. Benchmarks and evaluation
5. Handover/Integration steps

## Open Questions
- [ ] TBD
