# Task 8: Optimize for Performance and Scalability

Agent: Performance & Scaling Agent (agent_perf_scaling)
Why: These are infrastructure-heavy and can be researched/planned while core development is happening.

## Summary
Enhance the platform to handle enterprise-scale workloads and meet stringent performance requirements from ST-401 and ST-402.

## Focus & Key Decisions
Focus: distributed refactors (Spark/Flink), CUDA hotspots, K8s autoscaling, streaming throughput tuning, batch >20GB.
Key decisions: partitioning strategies, kernel tiling, HPA signals, serialization formats (Avro/Protobuf).

## Dependencies
- 6: Build Finance Module for Market Regime Detection
- 7: Build Cybersecurity Module for Anomaly Detection

## Deliverables
- Architecture overview and data flow
- Detailed spec and acceptance tests derived from 'Test Strategy'
- Milestone plan with risks and mitigations
- Open questions and research notes

## Details
Refactor critical algorithms for distributed computation using Apache Spark/Flink. Optimize C++ code for GPU acceleration via CUDA. Implement horizontal scaling for the API using Kubernetes and a load balancer. Ensure the system can process datasets >20GB and handle streaming data rates >10,000 events/sec.

## Test Strategy
Conduct comprehensive load testing to verify horizontal scaling and latency under load (<100ms). Benchmark performance on large datasets (>1M points, >20GB) to confirm efficiency goals. Profile memory usage to ensure it remains bounded during stream processing.

## Milestones
1. Requirements refinement and literature scan
2. Prototype design and validation criteria
3. Implementation plan (phased)
4. Benchmarks and evaluation
5. Handover/Integration steps

## Open Questions
- [ ] TBD
