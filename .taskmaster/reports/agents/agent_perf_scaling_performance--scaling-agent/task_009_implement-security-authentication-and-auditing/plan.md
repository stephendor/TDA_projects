# Task 9: Implement Security, Authentication, and Auditing

Agent: Performance & Scaling Agent (agent_perf_scaling)
Why: These are infrastructure-heavy and can be researched/planned while core development is happening.

## Summary
Harden the platform by implementing security and compliance features as specified in user stories ST-201 and ST-202.

## Focus & Key Decisions
Focus: authN (MFA), RBAC, audit trail, encryption in motion/at rest.
Key decisions: provider selection (OIDC), scopes/roles, immutable logs, KMS configs.

## Dependencies
- 4: Develop Prototype UI for Core Analysis Workflow

## Deliverables
- Architecture overview and data flow
- Detailed spec and acceptance tests derived from 'Test Strategy'
- Milestone plan with risks and mitigations
- Open questions and research notes

## Details
Integrate an authentication provider supporting multi-factor authentication (MFA). Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for all API endpoints and data access. Create a comprehensive logging system that produces an immutable audit trail for all analyses, parameters, and data access events. Encrypt all sensitive data at rest and in transit.

## Test Strategy
Perform penetration testing to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities. Conduct a security audit to verify that RBAC rules are correctly enforced and that the audit trail is complete and tamper-proof. Validate encryption standards.

## Milestones
1. Requirements refinement and literature scan
2. Prototype design and validation criteria
3. Implementation plan (phased)
4. Benchmarks and evaluation
5. Handover/Integration steps

## Open Questions
- [ ] TBD
