# Task 10: Finalize UI/UX and Implement Mapper Algorithm

Agent: Performance & Scaling Agent (agent_perf_scaling)
Why: These are infrastructure-heavy and can be researched/planned while core development is happening.

## Summary
Enhance the user interface based on beta feedback and implement the Mapper algorithm with its interactive visualization as per FR-CORE-003.

## Focus & Key Decisions
Focus: Mapper algorithm, UI polish, accessibility.
Key decisions: filter functions, clustering params, visualization interactions, WCAG checks.

## Dependencies
- 4: Develop Prototype UI for Core Analysis Workflow
- 8: Optimize for Performance and Scalability

## Deliverables
- Architecture overview and data flow
- Detailed spec and acceptance tests derived from 'Test Strategy'
- Milestone plan with risks and mitigations
- Open questions and research notes

## Details
Refine the UI/UX based on design principles and user feedback, focusing on domain-specific workflows. Implement the Mapper algorithm with customizable filter functions and clustering options (DBSCAN, k-means). Develop the interactive Mapper graph explorer using D3.js or Plotly for visualization. Ensure the UI meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.

## Test Strategy
Conduct usability testing with target users (quantitative analysts, cybersecurity analysts) to validate the new workflows. Verify the Mapper implementation against known examples from academic literature. Use automated tools and manual checks to validate accessibility compliance.

## Milestones
1. Requirements refinement and literature scan
2. Prototype design and validation criteria
3. Implementation plan (phased)
4. Benchmarks and evaluation
5. Handover/Integration steps

## Open Questions
- [ ] TBD
