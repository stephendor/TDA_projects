# Task ID: 7
# Title: Build Cybersecurity Module for Anomaly Detection
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement features for real-time network traffic analysis and threat detection as per FR-CYB-001, FR-CYB-002, and ST-103.
# Details:
Utilize the streaming architecture (Task 3) to process network packet streams in real-time. Implement sliding window analysis to extract topological features from traffic data. Develop models to detect deviations from baseline topological signatures and classify common attack patterns (DDoS, SQL injection).

# Test Strategy:
Test the module with captured network traffic datasets (e.g., CIC-IDS2017). Conduct red team exercises to validate detection capabilities against live attacks. Measure and optimize for a false positive rate below 50% and classification accuracy above 75%.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate with Real-time Network Packet Stream [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Connect the cybersecurity module to the streaming architecture defined in Task 3 to consume real-time network packet data.
### Details:
Implement a Kafka consumer or equivalent client to subscribe to the network traffic topic provided by the streaming architecture. Ensure robust data ingestion, deserialization, and error handling for a continuous, high-throughput data flow as per ST-103.

## 2. Implement Sliding Window and Packet Preprocessing [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop the logic for segmenting the incoming network stream into time-based sliding windows and preprocess the raw packet data within each window.
### Details:
Define a configurable window size and slide interval. For each window, convert raw packet information (source/destination IPs, ports, protocols, payload size) into a numerical format suitable for topological feature extraction, such as point clouds or graph adjacency matrices.

## 3. Extract Topological Features from Traffic Windows [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Apply topological data analysis to the preprocessed data in each sliding window to generate topological signatures for network traffic.
### Details:
Utilize the core TDA engine (Task 1) and advanced learnable features (Task 5) to compute persistence diagrams, Betti numbers, and other relevant topological features for each window of network traffic. This forms the basis for the baseline and detection models.

## 4. Develop Baseline Traffic Profile Model [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Create a model that learns the topological signatures of normal, non-malicious network traffic to establish a behavioral baseline.
### Details:
Train an unsupervised model (e.g., clustering, density estimation, or an autoencoder) on topological features extracted from a known 'clean' portion of a dataset like CIC-IDS2017. This model will define the signature of "normal" network behavior.

## 5. Implement Anomaly Deviation Detection Algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Develop the algorithm to detect significant deviations from the established baseline traffic profile in real-time.
### Details:
Implement a mechanism to compare the topological signature of each new traffic window against the baseline model. Use a statistical measure (e.g., Wasserstein distance) or model output score to flag windows that are anomalous. Tune the sensitivity threshold.

## 6. Develop Attack Pattern Classification Model [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Build and train a supervised machine learning model to classify detected anomalies into specific attack types as per FR-CYB-002 (DDoS, SQL injection).
### Details:
Using a labeled dataset (e.g., CIC-IDS2017), train a supervised classifier (e.g., Gradient Boosting, GNN, or a custom deep learning model) on the topological features to distinguish between different attack patterns and normal traffic.

## 7. Offline Performance Evaluation and Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.5, 7.6
### Description: Systematically test and optimize the anomaly detection and classification models using the full CIC-IDS2017 dataset to meet performance requirements.
### Details:
Run the entire detection and classification pipeline on the benchmark dataset. Measure and log performance metrics, iterating on model parameters, feature selection, and detection thresholds to achieve a false positive rate below 50% and classification accuracy above 75%.

## 8. Red Team Exercise and Live System Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.7
### Description: Validate the module's effectiveness against simulated live attacks in a controlled environment and perform final tuning.
### Details:
Collaborate with a red team to conduct controlled attack simulations (DDoS, SQL injection) against the deployed module in a staging environment. Monitor the module's real-time detection and classification performance, and refine alerting thresholds based on the results.
