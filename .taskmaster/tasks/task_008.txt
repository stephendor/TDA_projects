# Task ID: 8
# Title: Optimize for Performance and Scalability
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance the platform to handle enterprise-scale workloads and meet stringent performance requirements from ST-401 and ST-402.
# Details:
Refactor critical algorithms for distributed computation using Apache Spark/Flink. Optimize C++ code for GPU acceleration via CUDA. Implement horizontal scaling for the API using Kubernetes and a load balancer. Ensure the system can process datasets >20GB and handle streaming data rates >10,000 events/sec.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct comprehensive load testing to verify horizontal scaling and latency under load (<100ms). Benchmark performance on large datasets (>1M points, >20GB) to confirm efficiency goals. Profile memory usage to ensure it remains bounded during stream processing.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Refactor Core Algorithms for Distributed Processing with Spark/Flink [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and refactor computationally intensive algorithms from the Finance (Task 6) and Cybersecurity (Task 7) modules to run on a distributed computing framework like Apache Spark or Flink, enabling parallel execution.
### Details:
Analyze algorithms for topological feature extraction, market regime detection, and anomaly detection. Rewrite the core logic using Spark/Flink APIs (e.g., DataFrames, DataStream API) to distribute the computational load across a cluster. This is the foundation for handling large datasets and high-velocity streams.

## 2. Optimize C++ Components with CUDA for GPU Acceleration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Profile performance-critical C++ code sections within the analysis pipeline and rewrite them using CUDA to leverage GPU hardware for acceleration.
### Details:
Identify computational bottlenecks in the C++ codebase, likely related to numerical calculations or graph algorithms. Implement custom CUDA kernels for these sections. Manage data transfer and memory synchronization between the CPU (host) and GPU (device) to maximize performance gains.

## 3. Implement Horizontal API Scaling with Kubernetes [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Containerize the platform's API services and configure a Kubernetes environment to enable automated horizontal scaling and load balancing.
### Details:
Create Dockerfiles for the API services. Develop Kubernetes Deployment and Service manifests. Implement a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to automatically adjust the number of running pods based on real-time CPU or memory metrics. Configure an Ingress controller to manage and distribute incoming traffic.

## 4. Optimize Streaming Pipeline for High-Throughput Ingestion [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Tune the end-to-end streaming architecture to reliably process and analyze data streams at rates exceeding 10,000 events per second.
### Details:
Optimize the configuration of the message broker (e.g., Kafka partitions, replication). Tune the Spark/Flink streaming application's parameters, such as batch intervals, watermarking, and state management backends. Evaluate and implement efficient data serialization formats like Avro or Protobuf.

## 5. Optimize Batch Processing Jobs for Large Datasets [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Ensure the refactored distributed algorithms can efficiently process static datasets larger than 20GB within defined performance SLOs.
### Details:
Fine-tune Spark/Flink job configurations for large-scale batch processing. Optimize memory allocation (executor memory, overhead), data partitioning strategies, and shuffle operations. Implement efficient data read/write patterns for the underlying storage system (e.g., HDFS, S3).

## 6. Conduct Full-Scale Performance and Load Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5
### Description: Execute a comprehensive suite of benchmark and load tests to validate that the optimized system meets all specified performance requirements, including latency, throughput, and data volume.
### Details:
Design and run load tests against the horizontally-scaled API to verify latency remains below 100ms under heavy concurrent load. Execute the optimized batch jobs on >20GB datasets to confirm performance goals. Stress test the streaming pipeline with sustained traffic >10,000 events/sec. Profile memory usage to ensure it remains bounded.
