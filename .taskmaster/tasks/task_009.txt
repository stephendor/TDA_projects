# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Security, Authentication, and Auditing
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Harden the platform by implementing security and compliance features as specified in user stories ST-201 and ST-202.
# Details:
Integrate an authentication provider supporting multi-factor authentication (MFA). Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for all API endpoints and data access. Create a comprehensive logging system that produces an immutable audit trail for all analyses, parameters, and data access events. Encrypt all sensitive data at rest and in transit.

# Test Strategy:
Perform penetration testing to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities. Conduct a security audit to verify that RBAC rules are correctly enforced and that the audit trail is complete and tamper-proof. Validate encryption standards.
