# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Security, Authentication, and Auditing
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Harden the platform by implementing security and compliance features as specified in user stories ST-201 and ST-202.
# Details:
Integrate an authentication provider supporting multi-factor authentication (MFA). Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for all API endpoints and data access. Create a comprehensive logging system that produces an immutable audit trail for all analyses, parameters, and data access events. Encrypt all sensitive data at rest and in transit.

# Test Strategy:
Perform penetration testing to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities. Conduct a security audit to verify that RBAC rules are correctly enforced and that the audit trail is complete and tamper-proof. Validate encryption standards.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Research & Integrate Authentication Provider [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Evaluate and select a third-party identity provider (e.g., Auth0, Okta, Keycloak) or a self-hosted solution. Integrate the chosen provider's SDK into the backend to handle user authentication and token issuance (JWTs).
### Details:


## 2. Implement Frontend Authentication Flow [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build the necessary UI components in the React app for user login, logout, and session management. Implement protected routes that require a valid authentication token to access.
### Details:


## 3. Develop Backend API Authentication Middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create middleware for the FastAPI application that intercepts incoming requests, validates the JWT, and attaches the authenticated user's identity to the request context for use in downstream logic.
### Details:


## 4. Design Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Schema [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the user roles (e.g., Admin, Analyst, Viewer) and map them to specific permissions (e.g., `can_run_analysis`, `can_view_results`, `can_manage_users`). This design should be documented and aligned with ST-201.
### Details:


## 5. Implement RBAC Enforcement in API Endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Apply the RBAC rules to the API endpoints. This involves creating decorators or dependencies in FastAPI that check the user's role and permissions before allowing an operation to proceed.
### Details:


## 6. Design Immutable Audit Trail Schema and Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design a database schema (likely in a dedicated PostgreSQL table or MongoDB collection) for the audit log. The schema must capture who did what, when, and with what parameters. Plan for immutability, for example, by using append-only permissions or blockchain-inspired techniques.
### Details:


## 7. Implement Audit Logging for Critical Events [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate logging hooks into the backend services to record all critical events as defined in ST-202, such as user logins, analysis runs, data uploads, and configuration changes.
### Details:


## 8. Configure Encryption At-Rest and In-Transit [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enable and configure Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for the PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases. Ensure all external network traffic is encrypted using TLS/SSL, typically configured at the load balancer or ingress controller level.
### Details:


## 9. Conduct Internal Security Audit & Code Review [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform a thorough internal review of all security-related code and configurations. This includes checking for common vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10), verifying RBAC logic, and ensuring the audit trail is comprehensive.
### Details:


## 10. Schedule and Execute External Penetration Test [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Engage a third-party security firm to conduct a professional penetration test on the deployed application. This provides an unbiased assessment of the platform's security posture and helps identify vulnerabilities missed during internal reviews.
