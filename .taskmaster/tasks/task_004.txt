# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop Prototype UI for Core Analysis Workflow
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a basic user interface for running analyses and visualizing the primary results of persistent homology.
# Details:
Build a React frontend application that allows users to upload a dataset, configure and trigger a persistent homology computation via the backend API, and view the resulting persistence diagram. Use Three.js or D3.js for interactive 2D/3D visualization of diagrams.

# Test Strategy:
Perform end-to-end testing of the primary user workflow: data upload, analysis execution, and result visualization. Conduct initial usability testing on the prototype to gather feedback on the workflow and interface clarity.
