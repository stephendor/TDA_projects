# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop Prototype UI for Core Analysis Workflow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a basic user interface for running analyses and visualizing the primary results of persistent homology.
# Details:
Build a React frontend application that allows users to upload a dataset, configure and trigger a persistent homology computation via the backend API, and view the resulting persistence diagram. Use Three.js or D3.js for interactive 2D/3D visualization of diagrams.

# Test Strategy:
Perform end-to-end testing of the primary user workflow: data upload, analysis execution, and result visualization. Conduct initial usability testing on the prototype to gather feedback on the workflow and interface clarity.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Setup Frontend Project & Tooling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the React application using a modern toolchain (e.g., Vite or Create React App). Configure essential tooling including a linter (ESLint), code formatter (Prettier), and a basic folder structure for components, services, and styles.
### Details:


## 2. Design & Implement API Client Service [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a dedicated service layer (e.g., using Axios or `fetch`) to handle all communication with the backend API (from Task 3). This service will manage API endpoints, request/response formats, and error handling, providing a clean interface for UI components.
### Details:


## 3. Build Data Upload Component [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a React component that allows users to select and upload a dataset file (e.g., CSV, point cloud data). This component should provide visual feedback on upload progress and handle potential upload errors.
