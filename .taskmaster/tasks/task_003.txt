# Task ID: 3
# Title: Build Backend API and Initial Streaming Infrastructure
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the core backend services, including a Python API for orchestration and a data streaming pipeline for real-time processing.
# Details:
Develop a Python API (e.g., using FastAPI) to expose and orchestrate the C++ TDA computations. Configure Apache Kafka for high-throughput event streaming and set up an initial Apache Flink project for stream processing to support future real-time features like FR-CYB-001.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct unit and integration testing for all API endpoints. Verify the streaming pipeline by testing message production and consumption through Kafka. Run a simple Flink job to confirm the stream processing setup is functional.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement FastAPI Application with C++ TDA Core Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the initial FastAPI project structure and implement the mechanism to call the C++ persistent homology algorithms developed in Task 1.
### Details:
Set up a FastAPI application. Develop Python bindings using pybind11 or a subprocess-based wrapper to invoke the C++ TDA engine. Create a preliminary API endpoint to test the invocation of a C++ computation (e.g., Vietoris-Rips) and confirm that results can be passed back to the Python layer. This subtask is dependent on the completion of the C++ engine from Task 1.

## 2. Develop API Endpoints for TDA Computation Orchestration [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Implement the full set of RESTful API endpoints required to manage the lifecycle of TDA computations, from data submission to result retrieval.
### Details:
Create endpoints for: 1) Uploading point cloud data. 2) Initiating an asynchronous TDA computation job, specifying the algorithm and its parameters. 3) Checking the status of a running job. 4) Retrieving computation results (e.g., persistence diagrams, Betti numbers) once complete. These endpoints will orchestrate the C++ core via the integration layer from subtask 3.1.

## 3. Install and Configure Apache Kafka Cluster [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a foundational Apache Kafka cluster to serve as the backbone for high-throughput, real-time event streaming.
### Details:
Deploy a Kafka cluster using Docker Compose for a reproducible development environment. Configure brokers and ZooKeeper. Create the initial topics required for the data pipeline (e.g., `raw_data_events`, `tda_feature_results`) and define their partition and replication strategies to support future scalability needs.

## 4. Integrate Kafka Producer into the Backend API [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.3
### Description: Implement functionality within the Python API to produce messages to the Kafka cluster, enabling real-time event publishing.
### Details:
Add a Kafka client library (e.g., `kafka-python`) to the FastAPI application. Create a service or utility function that allows API endpoints to publish events. For example, when a TDA computation is completed, the API will publish the resulting features to the `tda_feature_results` topic.

## 5. Set Up Initial Apache Flink Project for Stream Consumption [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Create a basic Flink stream processing application that consumes data from Kafka to validate the end-to-end streaming infrastructure.
### Details:
Set up a Flink development environment. Create a simple Flink job (using Python's DataStream API) that connects to the Kafka cluster as a source, reads messages from a topic (e.g., `tda_feature_results`), performs a trivial transformation (e.g., logging the message or counting features), and writes the output to a log sink. This confirms the Flink-Kafka connector is working.
