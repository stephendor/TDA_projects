# Task ID: 3
# Title: Build Backend API and Initial Streaming Infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the core backend services, including a Python API for orchestration and a data streaming pipeline for real-time processing.
# Details:
Develop a Python API (e.g., using FastAPI) to expose and orchestrate the C++ TDA computations. Configure Apache Kafka for high-throughput event streaming and set up an initial Apache Flink project for stream processing to support future real-time features like FR-CYB-001.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct unit and integration testing for all API endpoints. Verify the streaming pipeline by testing message production and consumption through Kafka. Run a simple Flink job to confirm the stream processing setup is functional.
