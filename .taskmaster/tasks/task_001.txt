# Task ID: 1
# Title: Implement Core Persistent Homology Algorithms
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the foundational persistent homology computation engine to calculate topological features from point cloud data, as specified in FR-CORE-001.
# Details:
Implement support for Vietoris-Rips, Alpha, Čech, and DTM filtrations using performance-critical C++ and libraries like GUDHI or Ripser. The engine must compute Betti numbers for dimensions 0-3 and generate persistence diagrams and barcodes. It should be optimized to handle point clouds with over 100,000 points efficiently.

# Test Strategy:
Validate correctness by comparing outputs against established TDA libraries on benchmark datasets. Implement unit tests for all core algorithms and filtration methods. Conduct performance testing to ensure it meets the criteria in ST-101 (processing >1M points in <60s).

# Subtasks:
## 1. Setup C++ Environment and Integrate Core TDA Library [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the C++ development environment, including the build system (CMake), and integrate the chosen third-party TDA library (e.g., GUDHI) as a core dependency for all subsequent development.
### Details:
Configure the project structure, compiler flags for performance (-O3), and a basic continuous integration pipeline. Write a 'hello world' TDA example to confirm the library is correctly linked and functional by computing persistence for a small, known point cloud.

## 2. Implement Vietoris-Rips (VR) Filtration and Persistence Computation [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Implement the core logic to construct a Vietoris-Rips filtration from input point cloud data and compute its persistent homology up to dimension 3.
### Details:
Develop a C++ class that takes a point cloud (as a matrix or vector of vectors) and a maximum filtration radius. Use the integrated GUDHI/Ripser library to build the VR complex and run the persistence algorithm.

## 3. Implement Alpha Complex Filtration and Persistence Computation [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Implement the logic to construct an Alpha complex filtration from input point cloud data and compute its persistent homology up to dimension 3.
### Details:
Develop a C++ module for Alpha complex construction, which requires an interface with a computational geometry library (e.g., CGAL, a dependency of GUDHI). The function will take a point cloud and compute persistence based on the Alpha filtration.
<info added on 2025-08-12T16:28:54.812Z>
The implementation has been successfully completed. Integration with GUDHI and its CGAL dependency was achieved by resolving several technical challenges:
- Corrected CGAL kernel types (Epeck for 2D, Alpha_complex_3d for 3D) to fix compatibility issues.
- Resolved GMP/MPFR library linking problems within the CMake configuration.
- Updated GUDHI API calls to use simplex handles for persistent cohomology computation.
- Modified filtration value types to correctly handle NaN values as required by GUDHI.
- Fixed C++ method overload issues to enable successful compilation of Python bindings.

The final module now supports both 2D and 3D point clouds with automatic dimension detection, computes persistent cohomology, and is fully integrated into the TDA platform's build system, including core libraries, Python bindings, and test executables.

## 6. Implement Betti Number Calculation Utility [done]
### Dependencies: 1.5
### Description: Create a utility to compute Betti numbers (β₀, β₁, β₂, β₃) from the generated persistence diagrams for a given filtration value.
### Details:
Implement a function that takes a persistence diagram and a filtration value (epsilon) as input. It must count the number of persistence intervals [b, d) for each dimension k such that b <= epsilon < d to calculate the Betti number βₖ(epsilon).

## 7. Optimize Engine for Large-Scale Point Clouds (>1M points) [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Profile and optimize the performance of all implemented filtration methods to meet the ST-101 requirement of processing over 1 million points in under 60 seconds.

## 9. Implement Čech Complex Approximation Algorithm [done]
### Dependencies: 1.12
### Description: Implement an efficient approximation algorithm for the Čech complex using techniques like witness complexes or alpha-shape approximations. This should handle the computational complexity of exact Čech complex construction while maintaining topological accuracy.

## 11. Implement DTM-Based Filtration Construction [done]
### Dependencies: 1.10
### Description: Build the filtration construction algorithm that uses the DTM function values to create a robust filtration resistant to noise and outliers in the point cloud data.
### Details:
DTM-based filtration construction requires:
1. Integration with the DTM function computation
2. Filtration value assignment based on DTM values
3. Robust parameter selection for noise handling
4. Comparison with standard Vietoris-Rips filtration
5. Performance optimization for large datasets
<info added on 2025-08-12T17:08:28.390Z>
The implemented filtration assigns the maximum DTM value of its constituent vertices as the filtration value for any given simplex. This 'max' rule provides significant robustness to noise; any simplex containing an outlier (a point with a high DTM value) is assigned a high filtration value, delaying its entry into the filtration and minimizing the creation of spurious topological features. The construction is integrated with GUDHI's `Simplex_tree` for efficient management. Testing on a 12-point 2D point cloud confirmed the successful generation of a 298-simplex filtration up to dimension 2, which integrates correctly with the persistence computation pipeline.
