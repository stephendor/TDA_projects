# Task ID: 1
# Title: Implement Core Persistent Homology Algorithms
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the foundational persistent homology computation engine to calculate topological features from point cloud data, as specified in FR-CORE-001.
# Details:
Implement support for Vietoris-Rips, Alpha, Čech, and DTM filtrations using performance-critical C++ and libraries like GUDHI or Ripser. The engine must compute Betti numbers for dimensions 0-3 and generate persistence diagrams and barcodes. It should be optimized to handle point clouds with over 100,000 points efficiently.

# Test Strategy:
Validate correctness by comparing outputs against established TDA libraries on benchmark datasets. Implement unit tests for all core algorithms and filtration methods. Conduct performance testing to ensure it meets the criteria in ST-101 (processing >1M points in <60s).

# Subtasks:
## 1. Setup C++ Environment and Integrate Core TDA Library [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the C++ development environment, including the build system (CMake), and integrate the chosen third-party TDA library (e.g., GUDHI) as a core dependency for all subsequent development.
### Details:
Configure the project structure, compiler flags for performance (-O3), and a basic continuous integration pipeline. Write a 'hello world' TDA example to confirm the library is correctly linked and functional by computing persistence for a small, known point cloud.

## 2. Implement Vietoris-Rips (VR) Filtration and Persistence Computation [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Implement the core logic to construct a Vietoris-Rips filtration from input point cloud data and compute its persistent homology up to dimension 3.
### Details:
Develop a C++ class that takes a point cloud (as a matrix or vector of vectors) and a maximum filtration radius. Use the integrated GUDHI/Ripser library to build the VR complex and run the persistence algorithm.

## 3. Implement Alpha Complex Filtration and Persistence Computation [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Implement the logic to construct an Alpha complex filtration from input point cloud data and compute its persistent homology up to dimension 3.
### Details:
Develop a C++ module for Alpha complex construction, which requires an interface with a computational geometry library (e.g., CGAL, a dependency of GUDHI). The function will take a point cloud and compute persistence based on the Alpha filtration.

## 4. Implement Čech and DTM Filtrations [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Add support for computing persistent homology using Čech complex and Distance-To-Measure (DTM) filtrations to handle different data properties like noise.
### Details:
Implement the Čech complex, likely using an approximation for efficiency. Implement the DTM filtration, which requires computing a distance-to-measure function on the point cloud before building a Rips-like filtration based on the new metric.

## 5. Implement Persistence Diagram and Barcode Data Structure Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Develop data structures and serialization functions to represent and export the computed persistence pairs as persistence diagrams and barcodes.
### Details:
Create C++ structs/classes to store persistence pairs (birth, death, dimension). Write functions to format this data into a standardized, serializable format (e.g., JSON or a binary format) for both diagrams (list of [dim, birth, death] points) and barcodes (list of [dim, birth, death] intervals).

## 6. Implement Betti Number Calculation Utility [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.5
### Description: Create a utility to compute Betti numbers (β₀, β₁, β₂, β₃) from the generated persistence diagrams for a given filtration value.
### Details:
Implement a function that takes a persistence diagram and a filtration value (epsilon) as input. It must count the number of persistence intervals [b, d) for each dimension k such that b <= epsilon < d to calculate the Betti number βₖ(epsilon).

## 7. Optimize Engine for Large-Scale Point Clouds (>1M points) [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Profile and optimize the performance of all implemented filtration methods to meet the ST-101 requirement of processing over 1 million points in under 60 seconds.
### Details:
Use profiling tools (e.g., gprof, Valgrind/Callgrind) to identify bottlenecks. Implement optimizations such as multi-threading for complex construction, sparse matrix representations, and memory pooling. Investigate and implement approximation algorithms like sparse Rips filtrations.

## 8. Develop C++ API and Python Bindings for the Homology Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.6, 1.7
### Description: Design and implement a clean C++ API for the engine and create Python bindings to allow other services (like Task 2) to call the C++ code.
### Details:
Define a stable C++ API that exposes functions for computing persistence with different filtrations and retrieving results. Use pybind11 to wrap the C++ API, enabling efficient data transfer between Python (NumPy arrays) and C++ (Eigen matrices or std::vector).
