# Task ID: 10
# Title: Finalize UI/UX and Implement Mapper Algorithm
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 4, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the user interface based on beta feedback and implement the Mapper algorithm with its interactive visualization as per FR-CORE-003.
# Details:
Refine the UI/UX based on design principles and user feedback, focusing on domain-specific workflows. Implement the Mapper algorithm with customizable filter functions and clustering options (DBSCAN, k-means). Develop the interactive Mapper graph explorer using D3.js or Plotly for visualization. Ensure the UI meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct usability testing with target users (quantitative analysts, cybersecurity analysts) to validate the new workflows. Verify the Mapper implementation against known examples from academic literature. Use automated tools and manual checks to validate accessibility compliance.
