TDA Topology Enhancement Success Analysis
========================================

This script analyzes the breakthrough results from enhanced topology setup
and documents the progression from simple to complex attacks with proper TDA.

PROGRESSION RESULTS:
• SSH-Bruteforce (simple): 46.7% accuracy (coin flip territory)
• Infilteration (complex): 53.3% accuracy (+6.6 points improvement)
• Bot (enhanced topology): 97.4% accuracy (+44.1 points BREAKTHROUGH)

CRITICAL INSIGHTS:
1. Coordinated attacks (Bot) exhibit rich topological structure
2. Enhanced multi-dimensional point cloud construction is key
3. Feature grouping (flow, timing, packet, protocol) enables better topology
4. Higher-dimensional persistence analysis (H0, H1, H2) captures coordination patterns
