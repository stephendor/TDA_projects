## Objectives

- Performance & Scale (Task 8): Distributed refactors, GPU offload, API horizontal scale, stream throughput
- Security (Task 9): AuthN (MFA), RBAC, audit logging, encryption in transit/at rest
- UI/UX + Mapper (Task 10): Interaction design, Mapper algorithm plan, accessibility

## Task 8 — Optimize for Performance and Scalability

### System Targets

- Datasets > 20GB; streams > 10k events/s; API p95 < 100ms under load

### Architecture Plan

- Batch/Stream split with Spark/Flink; containerized API behind Kubernetes Ingress + HPA
- GPU offload candidates: distance computations, filtration construction, graph ops

### Execution Plan

- Identify hotspots via profiling; refactor to Spark/Flink operators
- CUDA kernels for computational kernels; manage host↔device with pinned memory
- HPA config: CPU- or custom-metrics-driven scaling

### Load/Perf Testing

- Synthetic generators for batch and stream; Locust/k6 for API
- Metrics: latency distributions, throughput, memory footprint

### Acceptance Checklist

- Distributed jobs produce equivalent results to single-node baselines
- GPU kernels validated vs CPU for correctness; measurable speedups reported
- Kubernetes manifests prepared; scale-out test shows p95 latency < 100ms

## Task 9 — Security, Authentication, and Auditing

### Authentication

- Provider: OIDC-compliant (Auth0/Keycloak); enforce MFA for privileged roles
- Token handling: short-lived access tokens; refresh token rotation; TLS 1.3

### RBAC Model

- Roles: `admin`, `analyst`, `reader`, `service`
- Protect all API endpoints and data access; least privilege defaults

### Auditing

- Immutable audit trail: append-only store with hash chaining
- Events logged: who, what, when, where, spec/version hashes, dataset IDs
- Log schema (example):
```json
{
  "event_id": "uuid",
  "actor": {"type": "user|service", "id": "..."},
  "action": "compute_features|read|export",
  "resource": {"type": "tda_feature", "id": 123},
  "spec_hash": "...",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "ip": "...",
  "sig_prev": "...",
  "sig_curr": "..."
}
```

### Encryption

- In transit: TLS 1.3; mTLS between services
- At rest: AES-256-GCM for secrets; disk encryption for databases; KMS-backed key rotation

### Acceptance Checklist

- MFA enforced for admin; RBAC policies defined and tested
- Audit records present for all sensitive actions; tamper-evidence validated
- Encryption ciphers and configs documented and verified

## Task 10 — Finalize UI/UX and Implement Mapper Algorithm

### UI/UX Plan

- Users: quant analysts, security analysts; workflows tailored per domain
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA; keyboard navigation; color contrast; ARIA roles

### Mapper Algorithm Plan

- Filter functions: density, eccentricity, PCA component, custom domain metrics
- Cover: overlapping intervals; clustering: DBSCAN/k-means; parameterization documented
- Output: interactive Mapper graph with node summaries and edge connectivity

### Visualization

- Tech: D3.js or Plotly; interactions: hover, select, filter-by-attribute, drill-down to PDs/landscapes

### Acceptance Checklist

- Mapper implementation verified on canonical examples; parameters configurable
- UI flows for dataset upload → compute → Mapper explore; meets accessibility audits
- Performance: interaction p95 < 100ms on typical graphs
